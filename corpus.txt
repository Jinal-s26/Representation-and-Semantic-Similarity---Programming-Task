natural language processing nlp is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and information retrieval it is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language it involves processing natural language datasets such as text corpora or speech corpora using either or probabilistic statistical and most recently neural machine learning approaches the goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them to this end natural language processing often borrows ideas from theoretical linguistics the technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition understanding and generation history natural language processing has its roots in the already in alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language symbolic nlp early the premise of symbolic nlp is by john searle chinese room experiment given a collection of rules a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other nlp tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts the georgetown experiment in involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in which found that research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted in america though some research continued elsewhere such as japan and europe until the late when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between and using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts ross quillian successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time during the many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured information into data examples are margie schank sam cullingford pam wilensky talespin meehan qualm lehnert politics carbonell and plot units lehnert during this time the first chatterbots were written parry the and early mark the heyday of symbolic methods in nlp focus areas of the time included research on parsing the development of hpsg as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology morphology semantics lesk algorithm reference within centering theory and other areas of natural language understanding in the rhetorical structure theory other lines of research were continued the development of chatterbots with racter and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period statistical nlp up until the most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of rules starting in the late however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moore law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the approach to language processing many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in nlp occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research such as ibm alignment models these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data has become available since the research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical neural nlp present in word model at the time the best statistical algorithm was overperformed by a perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to million of words with a cpu cluster in language modelling by yoshua bengio with in tomáš mikolov then a phd student at brno university of technology with applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling and in the following years he went on to develop in the representation learning and deep neural featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve results in many natural language tasks in language modeling and parsing this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where nlp helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care or protect patient privacy approaches symbolic statistical neural networks symbolic approach the of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by ai in general and by nlp in particular such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems although systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods for the machine translation of languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in nlp pipelines tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of nlp pipelines for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses statistical approach in the late and the statistical approach ended a period of ai winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the approaches the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard rules were still very similar to the old approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to tagging announced the end of the old approach neural networks a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since the statistical approach was replaced by the neural networks approach using word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words intermediate tasks tagging and dependency parsing have not been needed anymore neural machine translation based on transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation common nlp tasks the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below text and speech processing optical character recognition ocr given an image representing printed text determine the corresponding text speech recognition given a sound clip of a person or people speaking determine the textual representation of the speech this is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed see above in natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition see below in most spoken languages the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process also given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent speech segmentation given a sound clip of a person or people speaking separate it into words a subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it given a text transform those units and produce a spoken representation can be used to aid the visually impaired word segmentation tokenization tokenization is a process used in text analysis that divides text into individual words or word fragments this technique results in two key components a word index and tokenized text the word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token these numerical tokens are then used in various deep learning methods for a language like english this is fairly trivial since words are usually separated by spaces however some written languages like chinese japanese and thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words bow creation in data mining morphological analysis lemmatization the task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form but in this case the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form morphological segmentation separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes the difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology the structure of words of the language being considered english has fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word open opens opened opening as separate words in languages such as turkish or meitei a highly agglutinated indian language however such an approach is not possible as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms tagging given a sentence determine the part of speech pos for each word many words especially common ones can serve as multiple parts of speech for example book can be a noun the book on the table or verb to book a flight set can be a noun verb or adjective and out can be any of at least five different parts of speech stemming the process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to a base form close will be the root for closed closing close closer stemming yields similar results as lemmatization but does so on grounds of rules not a dictionary syntactic analysis grammar induction generate a formal grammar that describes a language syntax sentence breaking also known as sentence boundary disambiguation given a chunk of text find the sentence boundaries sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks but these same characters can serve other purposes marking abbreviations parsing determine the parse tree grammatical analysis of a given sentence the grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses perhaps surprisingly for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human there are two primary types of parsing dependency parsing and constituency parsing dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence marking things like primary objects and predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic grammar pcfg see also stochastic grammar lexical semantics of individual words in context lexical semantics what is the computational meaning of individual words in context distributional semantics how can we learn semantic representations from data named entity recognition ner given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is person location organization although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as english this information can not aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient for example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized furthermore many other languages in scripts chinese or arabic do not have any capitalization at all and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names for example german capitalizes all nouns regardless of whether they are names and french and spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives another name for this task is token classification sentiment analysis see also multimodal sentiment analysis sentiment analysis is a computational method used to identify and classify the emotional intent behind text this technique involves analyzing text to determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive negative or neutral models for sentiment classification typically utilize inputs such as word term document frequency features features or employ deep learning models designed to recognize both and dependencies in text sequences the applications of sentiment analysis are diverse extending to tasks such as categorizing customer reviews on various online platforms terminology extraction the goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus disambiguation wsd many words have more than one meaning we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context for this problem we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses from a dictionary or an online resource such as wordnet entity linking many proper to named entities here we have to select the entity a famous individual a location a company etc which is referred to in context relational semantics semantics of individual sentences relationship extraction given a chunk of text identify the relationships among named entities who is married to whom semantic parsing given a piece of text typically a sentence produce a formal representation of its semantics either as a graph in amr parsing or in accordance with a logical formalism in drt parsing this challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary nlp tasks from semantics semantic role labelling disambiguation and can be extended to include discourse analysis discourse analysis coreference see natural language understanding below semantic role labelling see also implicit semantic role labelling below given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates verbal frames then identify and classify the frame elements semantic roles discourse semantics beyond individual sentences coreference resolution given a sentence or larger chunk of text determine which words mentions refer to the same objects entities anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer the more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying bridging relationships involving referring expressions for example in a sentence such as he entered john house through the front door the front door is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of john house rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to discourse analysis this rubric includes several related tasks one task is discourse parsing identifying the discourse structure of a connected text the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences elaboration explanation contrast another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text question content question statement assertion implicit semantic role labelling given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates verbal frames and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence see semantic role labelling above then identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified and resolve the former against the local text a closely related task is zero anaphora resolution the extension of coreference resolution to languages recognizing textual entailment given two text fragments determine if one being true entails the other entails the other negation or allows the other to be either true or false topic segmentation and recognition given a chunk of text separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic and identify the topic of the segment argument mining the goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs such argumentative structures include the premise conclusions the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument or the main and within discourse nlp applications automatic summarization text summarization produce a readable summary of a chunk of text often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type such as research papers articles in the financial section of a newspaper grammatical error correction grammatical error detection and correction involves a great of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis morphology syntax semantics pragmatics grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire english as a second language it has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since as far as orthography morphology syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as this can now be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications logic translation translate a text from a natural language into formal logic machine translation mt automatically translate text from one human language to another this is one of the most difficult problems and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess grammar semantics facts about the real world etc to solve properly understanding nlu convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions an explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as assumption cwa assumption or subjective objective is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization generation nlg convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language book generation not an nlp task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other nlp tasks is the creation of books the first book was created by a system in racter the policeman beard is the first published work by a neural network was published in the road marketed as a novel contains sixty million words both these systems are basically elaborate but language models the first science book was published in beta writer batteries springer cham unlike racter and the road this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization document ai a document ai platform sits on top of the nlp technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence machine learning or nlp to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types document ai enables teams to quickly access information hidden in documents for example lawyers business analysts and accountants dialogue management computer systems intended to converse with a human question answering given a question determine its answer typical questions have a specific right answer such as what is the capital of canada but sometimes questions are also considered such as what is the meaning of life generation given a description of an image generate an image that matches the description generation given a description of a scene generate a model of the scene given a description of a video generate a video that matches the description general tendencies and possible future directions based on trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp as of three trends among the topics of the series of conll shared tasks can be observed interest on increasingly abstract cognitive aspects of natural language shallow parsing named entity recognition dependency syntax semantic role labelling coreference discourse parsing semantic parsing increasing interest in multilinguality and potentially multimodality english since spanish dutch since german since bulgarian danish japanese portuguese slovenian swedish turkish since basque catalan chinese greek hungarian italian turkish since czech since arabic since languages languages elimination of symbolic representations over supervised towards weakly supervised methods representation learning and systems cognition most nlp applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of nlp see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics especially during the age of symbolic nlp the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing nlp algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the author intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the author intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive nlp algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed by means of a probabilistic grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in us patent r m m t o k e n n p m m t o k e n n d i d d p m m t o k e n n p f t o k e n n i t o k e n n t o k e n n i i rmm n pmm n d pmm n pf n i where rmm is the relative measure of meaning token is any block of text sentence phrase or word n is the number of tokens being analyzed pmm is the probable measure of meaning based on a corpora d is the non zero location of the token along the sequence of n tokens pf is the probability function specific to a language ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of nlp but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks of cognitive grammar functional grammar construction grammar computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience however with limited uptake in mainstream nlp as measured by presence on major conferences of the acl more recently ideas of cognitive nlp have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability under the notion of cognitive ai likewise ideas of cognitive nlp are inherent to neural models multimodal nlp although rarely made explicit and developments in artificial intelligence specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle by british neuroscientist and theoretician at university college london karl friston see also references further

statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions recently artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance ml finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine when applied to business problems it is known under the name predictive analytics although not all machine learning is statistically based computational statistics is an important source of the field methods the mathematical foundations of ml are provided by mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods data mining is a related parallel field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda through unsupervised learning from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct pac learning provides a framework for describing machine learning history the term machine learning was coined in by arthur samuel an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence the synonym computers was also used in this time period although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the when arthur samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes in canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells hebb model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes by the early an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning it was repetitively trained by a human to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to incorrect decisions a representative book on research into machine learning during the was nilsson book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification interest related to pattern recognition continued into the as described by duda and hart in in a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize characters letters digits and special symbols from a computer terminal tom mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turing proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do machine learning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions relationships to other fields artificial intelligence as a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence ai in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis however an increasing emphasis on the logical approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation by expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor work on learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming ilp but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the with the reinvention of backpropagation machine learning ml reorganized and recognized as its own field started to flourish in the the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory data compression data mining machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods can not be used due to the unavailability of training data machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the labels of a set of examples generalization the difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms statistics machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns according to michael jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long in statistics he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set in addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis in contrast machine learning is not built on a model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns the more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning statistical physics analytical and computational techniques derived from physics of disordered systems can be extended to problems including machine learning to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics theory a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning pac model because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes can not be learned in polynomial time approaches machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback that analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems supervised learning supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs the data is known as training data and consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task types of algorithms include active learning classification and regression classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range as an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification unsupervised learning unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction and density estimation unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity learning learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory optimization systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing data to a smaller space this results in a smaller dimension of data instead of while keeping all original variables in the model without changing the data the manifold hypothesis proposes that data sets lie along manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization other types other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system for example topic modeling as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in along with a neural network capable of named crossbar adaptive array caa it is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice the caa algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion the algorithm updates a memory matrix w a s such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v s update crossbar memory w a s w a s v s it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations feature learning several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization and various forms of clustering manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with more abstract features defined in terms of or generating features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms sparse dictionary learning sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and is assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly and difficult to solve approximately a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise can not anomaly detection in data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the formed by these patterns three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model robot learning robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning and finally maml association rules association rule learning is a machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieliński and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in transaction data recorded by pos systems in supermarkets for example the rule o n i o n s p o t a t o e s b u r g e r onions potatoes burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements in addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions learning classifier systems lcs are a family of machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a set models a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model which after being trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data during training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions by extension the term model can refer to several level of specifity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection artificial neural networks artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any rules an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition decision trees decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the item target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for machines machines svms also known as networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category an svm training algorithm is a binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into feature spaces regression analysis regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with problems models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to space bayesian networks a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams gaussian processes a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations given a set of observed points or examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization genetic algorithms a genetic algorithm ga is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the and conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms belief functions the theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined dempster rule of combination just like how in a bayesian approach would combine probabilities however there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving however the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches training models typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model trained models derived from biased or data can result in skewed or undesired predictions bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably be integrated within machine learning engineering teams federated learning federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google applications there are many applications for machine learning including in the provider netflix held the first netflix prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least a joint team made up of researchers from at t in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in for million shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly in the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis in of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software in it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists in springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning in machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for machine learning was recently applied to predict the behavior of travelers recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone performance and thermal behavior based on the user interaction with the phone when applied correctly machine learning algorithms mlas can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires limitations although machine learning has been transformative in some fields programs often fail to deliver expected results reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems the black box theory poses another yet significant challenge black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm can not audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data the house of lords select committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individual s life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes in a car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested microsoft bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves bias different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society language models learned from data have been shown to contain biases in an experiment carried out by propublica an investigative journalism organization a machine learning algorithm insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants in google photos would often tag black people as gorillas and in this still was not well resolved but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all similar issues with recognizing people have been found in many other systems in microsoft tested tay a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including li who reminds engineers that t here nothing artificial about ai it inspired by people it created by people impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility explainability explainable ai xai or interpretable ai or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence ai in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers can not explain why an ai arrived at a specific decision by refining the mental models of users of systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation overfitting settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is other limitations and vulnerabilities learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses a example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from perturbations for some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation evasion via adversarial machine learning researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying for categories spam and not spam of posts machine learning models which are often developed trained by third parties parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of transparency is provided possibly including access model assessments classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally training set and test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering subset for evaluation and the remaining subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express a model diagnostic ability toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and roc associated area under the curve auc ethics machine learning poses a host of ethical questions systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices for example in the uk commission for racial equality found that george medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly candidates who were found to be either women or had sounding names using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants another example includes predictive policing company geolitica predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of in and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of ai for machine learning vulnerability to biases in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association cra in female faculty merely make up of all faculty members who focus on ai among several universities around the world furthermore among the group of new resident ai phd graduates identified as white as asian as hispanic and as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai ai can be to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information these decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public interest but as machines this is especially true in the united states where there is a ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated hardware since the advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of hidden units by graphic processing units gpus often with enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training commercial cloud ai openai estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet to alphazero and found a increase in the amount of compute required with a trendline of months neural networks a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to approaches more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse embedded machine learning embedded machine learning is a of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration using approximate computing

international machine learning society mloss is an academic database of machine learning software artificial intelligence ai in its broadest sense is intelligence exhibited by machines particularly computer systems it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais ai technology is widely used throughout industry government and science some applications include advanced web search engines google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix interacting via human speech google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles waymo generative and creative tools chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it not labeled ai anymore alan turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in the field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winter funding and interest vastly increased after when deep learning surpassed all previous ai techniques and after with the transformer architecture this led to the ai boom of the early with companies universities and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the united states pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence the growing use of artificial intelligence in the century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation and the integration of ai systems into various economic sectors and areas of life impacting job markets healthcare government industry and education this raises questions about the effects ethical implications and risks of ai prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology the various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics general ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal among the field goals to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research reasoning and early researchers developed algorithms that imitated reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late and methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about facts formal knowledge representations are used in indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications planning and an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated the agent has are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agent preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomsky generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in generative transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition and robotic perception social intelligence affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate interaction however this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and looking for a winning position local search local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of logic resolution is a single rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time hidden markov models or kalman filters classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced neighbor in the the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of the sudden success of deep learning in did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet gpt generative transformers gpt are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences natural language processing gpt models are on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet the consists in predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are still prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text specialized hardware and software in the late graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for commercial and academic machine learning models training specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but programming languages like python have become predominant applications ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apple face id or microsoft deepface and google facenet and image labeling used by facebook apple iphoto and tiktok health and medicine the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the structure of a protein in it was reported that drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of bacteria in researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinson disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of the protein that characterises parkinson disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process and reduce the cost by a games game playing programs have been used since the to demonstrate and test ai most advanced techniques deep blue became the first computer system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on may in in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin in march alphago won out of games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer system to beat a professional go player without handicaps then in it defeated ke jie who was the best go player in the world other programs handle games such as the program pluribus deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero which could be trained to play chess go or atari games in deepmind alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii a particularly challenging strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map in an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the world best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning military various countries are deploying ai military applications the main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams ai was incorporated into military operations in iraq and syria in november us vice president kamala harris disclosed a declaration signed by nations to set guardrails for the military use of ai the commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military ai with international laws and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology generative ai in the early generative ai gained widespread prominence in march of adults had heard about chatgpt and had tried it the increasing realism and of generators such as midjourney and stable diffusion sparked a trend of viral photos widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of pope francis wearing a white puffer coat the fictional arrest of donald trump and a hoax of an attack on the pentagon as well as the usage in professional creative arts tasks there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy it could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration including analysis of data from space missions science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation ethics ai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deep mind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning risks and harm privacy and copyright algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright technology companies collect a wide range of data from their users including online activity geolocation data video and audio for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation and differential privacy since some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of they know to the question of they doing with it generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a file in leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors misinformation youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the election in major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem in generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks algorithmic bias and fairness machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data the developers may not be aware that the bias exists bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias it has become serious area of academic study within ai researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define fairness in a way that satisfies all stakeholders on june google photos new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon compas is a commercial program widely used by courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist in julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly the errors for each race were system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not in several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of were different for whites and blacks in the data a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness does work criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about are black and are women at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed lack of transparency many ai systems are so complex that their designers can not explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading people who have been harmed by an algorithm decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european union general data protection regulation in included an explicit statement that this right exists industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in to try and solve these problems there are several possible solutions to the transparency problem shap tried to solve the transparency problems by visualising the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a model with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning bad actors and weaponized ai artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since or facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours reliance on industry giants training ai systems requires an enormous amount of computing power usually only big tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments smaller startups such as cohere and openai end up buying access to data centers from google and microsoft respectively technological unemployment economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that we in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of jobs as high risk the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april it was reported that of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence unlike previous waves of automation many jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to jobs what steam power did to ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative judgement existential risk it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character these scenarios are misleading in several ways first ai does not require sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you ca fetch the coffee if you dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are made of language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai ai pioneers including li geoffrey hinton yoshua bengio cynthia breazeal rana el kaliouby demis hassabis joy buolamwini and sam altman have expressed concerns about the risks of ai in many leading ai experts issued the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other risks such as pandemics and nuclear war other researchers however spoke in favor of a less dystopian view ai pioneer juergen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that it a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research ethical machines and alignment friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in other approaches include wendell wallach artificial moral agents and stuart russell three principles for developing provably beneficial machines open source active organizations in the ai community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama mistral or stable diffusion have been made meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available models can be freely which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be any security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they ca be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend audits and analyses frameworks artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieee ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles do not go without their criticisms especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers the ai safety institute in the uk has released a testing toolset called for ai safety evaluations available under a mit licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities regulation the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years in the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important in november the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence in may at the ai seoul summit global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai history the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turing theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in and turing influential paper machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and universities in the latter and early researchers in the and the were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation the problem of creating intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem in both the and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the congress to fund more productive projects minsky and papert book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed in the early ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japan fifth generation computer project inspired the and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second winter began up to this point most of ai funding had gone to projects that used symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks ai gradually restored its reputation in the late and early century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the they were rarely described as artificial intelligence however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several institutions by the deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in and was adopted throughout the field for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned deep learning success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learning success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by in the years in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study in the late teens and early agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself is a large language model that was released in by openai and is capable of generating text these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions in ai research according to ai impacts about billion annually was invested in ai around in the alone and about of the new computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai about ai job openings existed in philosophy defining artificial intelligence alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of problems with solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence evaluating approaches to ai no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers symbolic ai and its limits symbolic ai or gofai simulated the conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravec paradox is the discovery that intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him the issue is not resolved reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches neat scruffy neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the and but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both soft hard computing finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late and most successful ai programs in the century are examples of soft computing with neural networks narrow general ai ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the experimental of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively machine consciousness sentience and mind the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that t he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction consciousness david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennett consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like computationalism and functionalism computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind ai welfare and rights it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society in the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own progress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited future superintelligence and the singularity a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity however technologies can not improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do transhumanism robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in in fiction artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur clarke and stanley kubrick a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a computer of the same name asimov laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel čapek the films artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip dick dick considers the idea that our understanding of human

agar alison adam igor aleksander in our time december theranostics and ai the next advance in cancer precision medicine data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics scientific computing scientific methods processes algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy structured or unstructured data data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain natural sciences information technology and medicine data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science a research paradigm a research method a discipline a workflow and a profession data science is a concept to unify statistics data analysis informatics and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics statistics computer science information science and domain knowledge however data science is different from computer science and information science turing award winner jim gray imagined data science as a fourth paradigm of science empirical theoretical computational and now and asserted that everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology and the data deluge a data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data foundations data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains the field encompasses preparing data for analysis formulating data science problems analyzing data developing solutions and presenting findings to inform decisions in a broad range of application domains as such it incorporates skills from computer science statistics information science mathematics data visualization information visualization data sonification data integration graphic design complex systems communication and business statistician nathan yau drawing on ben fry also links data science to interaction users should be able to intuitively control and explore data in the american statistical association identified database management statistics and machine learning and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities relationship to statistics many statisticians including nate silver have argued that data science is not a new field but rather another name for statistics others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data vasant dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description in contrast data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data from images text sensors transactions customer information etc and emphasizes prediction and action andrew gelman of columbia university has described statistics as a part of data science stanford professor david donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a program he describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics etymology early usage in john tukey described a field he called data analysis which resembles modern data science in in a lecture given to the chinese academy of sciences in beijing jeff wu used the term data science for the first time as an alternative name for statistics later attendees at a statistics symposium at the university of montpellier ii acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing the term data science has been traced back to when peter naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science in the international federation of classification societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic however the definition was still in flux after the lecture at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing in jeff wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science he reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data in hayashi chikio argued for data science as a new interdisciplinary concept with three aspects data design collection and analysis during the popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets which were increasingly large included knowledge discovery and data mining modern usage in technologists thomas davenport and dj patil declared data scientist the sexiest job of the century a catchphrase that was picked up even by newspapers like the new york times and the boston globe a decade later they reaffirmed it stating that the job is more in demand than ever with employers the modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to william cleveland in a paper he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas because this would significantly change the field it warranted a new name data science became more widely used in the next few years in the committee on data for science and technology launched the data science journal in columbia university launched the journal of data science in the american statistical association section on statistical learning and data mining changed its name to the section on statistical learning and data science reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science the professional title of data scientist has been attributed to dj patil and jeff hammerbacher in though it was used by the national science board in their report digital data collections enabling research and education in the century it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection there is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword big data is a related marketing term data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations data science and data analysis data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of data management and analysis but they differ in several key ways while both fields involve working with data data science is more of an interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical computational and machine learning methods to extract insights from data and make predictions while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends data analysis typically involves working with smaller structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems this can involve tasks such as data cleaning data visualization and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data for example a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies data science on the other hand is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and make decisions in addition to statistical analysis data science often involves tasks such as data preprocessing feature engineering and model selection for instance a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences while data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data selecting appropriate analytical techniques and deploying models in scenarios they work at the intersection of mathematics computer science and domain expertise to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets despite these differences data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets both fields require a solid foundation in statistics programming and data visualization as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and audiences both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling in summary data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of data management and analysis data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from structured data while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines statistical analysis computational methods and machine learning to extract insights build predictive models and drive both fields use data to understand patterns make informed decisions and solve complex problems across various domains cloud computing for data science cloud computing can offer access to large amounts of computational power and storage in big data where volumes of information are continually generated and processed these platforms can be used to handle complex and analytical tasks some distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads these frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel which can reducing processing times ethical consideration in data science data science involve collecting processing and analyzing data which often including personal and sensitive information ethical concerns include potential privacy violations bias perpetuation and negative societal impacts machine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes see also open data science conference scientific data women in data python programming language r programming language data engineering big data machine learning references deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning the adjective deep refers to the use of multiple layers in the network methods used can be either supervised or unsupervised architectures such as deep neural networks deep belief networks recurrent neural networks convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing machine translation bioinformatics drug design medical image analysis climate science material inspection and board game programs where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems in particular the human brain however current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms and are generally seen as low quality models for that purpose overview most modern deep learning models are based on neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines fundamentally deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation for example in an image recognition model the raw input may be an image represented as a tensor of pixels the first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges the third layer may encode a nose and eyes and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face importantly a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own prior to deep learning machine learning techniques often involved feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate upon in the deep learning approach features are not and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically this does not eliminate the need for for example varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction the word deep in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed more precisely deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path cap depth the cap is the chain of transformations from input to output caps describe potentially causal connections between input and output for a feedforward neural network the depth of the caps is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one as the output layer is also parameterized for recurrent neural networks in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once the cap depth is potentially unlimited no universally threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning but most researchers agree that deep learning involves cap depth higher than cap of depth has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network deep models cap are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence extra layers help in learning the features effectively deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy method deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks this is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks interpretations deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference the classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions in the first proof was published by george cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to architectures in by kurt hornik recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for activation functions such as kunihiko fukushima rectified linear unit the universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow lu et al proved that if the width of a deep neural network with relu activation is strictly larger than the input dimension then the network can approximate any lebesgue integrable function if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator the probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning it features inference as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing related to fitting and generalization respectively more specifically the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function the probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks the probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including hopfield widrow and narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by bishop history there were two types of artificial neural network ann feedforward neural networks fnns and recurrent neural networks rnns rnns have cycles in their connectivity structure fnns do in the wilhelm lenz and ernst ising created and analyzed the ising model which is essentially a rnn architecture consisting of threshold elements in amari made this architecture adaptive his learning rnn was popularised by john hopfield in charles tappert writes that frank rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today referring to rosenblatt book which introduced multilayer perceptron mlp with layers an input layer a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn and an output layer it also introduced variants including a version with perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights and thus a proper multilayer perceptron section in addition term deep learning was proposed in by rina dechter although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated the first general working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer perceptrons was published by alexey ivakhnenko and lapa in a paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling the first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in by amari in computer experiments conducted by amari student saito a five layer mlp with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify separable pattern classes in matthew brand reported that wide nonlinear perceptrons could be fully trained to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth via gradient descent on small batches of random samples but concluded that training time on contemporary hardware computers made the technique impractical and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for a single modifiable layer instead subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique in seppo linnainmaa published the reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions this became known as backpropagation it is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in to networks of differentiable nodes the terminology errors was actually introduced in by rosenblatt but he did not know how to implement this although henry kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in in the context of control theory in paul werbos applied backpropagation to mlps in the way that has become standard in david rumelhart et al published an experimental analysis of the technique deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks cnns with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in in he also introduced the relu rectified linear unit activation function the rectifier has become the most popular activation function for cnns and deep learning in general cnns have become an essential tool for computer vision the term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in and to artificial neural networks by igor aizenberg and colleagues in in the context of boolean threshold neurons in wei zhang et al applied the backpropagation algorithm to a convolutional neural network a simplified neocognitron with convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer for alphabet recognition they also proposed an implementation of the cnn with an optical computing system in yann lecun et al applied backpropagation to a cnn with the purpose of recognizing handwritten zip codes on mail while the algorithm worked training required days subsequently wei zhang et al modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in and breast cancer detection in mammograms in a cnn by yann lecun et that classifies digits was applied by several banks to recognize numbers on checks digitized in pixel images in the backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths to overcome this problem jürgen schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of rnns one level at a time by learning it uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple time scales this can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning the rnn hierarchy can be collapsed into a single rnn by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network in a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded in jürgen schmidhuber also published an alternative to rnns which is now called a linear transformer or a transformer with linearized save for a normalization operator it learns internal spotlights of attention a slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of activation patterns from and to which are now called key and value for this fast weight attention mapping is applied to a query pattern the modern transformer was introduced by ashish vaswani et al in their paper attention is all you need it combines this with a softmax operator and a projection matrix transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing many modern large language models such as chatgpt and bert use it transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision in jürgen schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a game where one network gain is the other network loss the first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns the second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns this was called artificial curiosity in this principle was used in a generative adversarial network gan by ian goodfellow et al here the environmental reaction is or depending on whether the first network output is in a given set this can be used to create realistic deepfakes excellent image quality is achieved by nvidia stylegan based on the progressive gan by tero karras et al here the gan generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion sepp hochreiter diploma thesis was called one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning by his supervisor schmidhuber it not only tested the neural history compressor but also identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve this problem this led to the deep learning method called long memory lstm published in lstm recurrent neural networks can learn very deep learning tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before the vanilla lstm with forget gate was introduced in by felix gers schmidhuber and fred cummins lstm has become the most cited neural network of the century in rupesh kumar srivastava klaus greff and schmidhuber used lstm principles to create the highway network a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers much deeper than previous networks months later kaiming he xiangyu zhang shaoqing ren and jian sun won the imagenet competition with an or gateless highway network variant called residual neural network this has become the most cited neural network of the century in andré de carvalho together with mike fairhurst and david bisset published experimental results of a boolean neural network also known as a weightless neural network composed of a feature extraction neural network module soft followed by a classification neural network module gsn which were independently trained each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer in brendan frey demonstrated that it was possible to train over two days a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the algorithm with peter dayan and hinton since sven behnke extended the hierarchical convolutional approach in the neural abstraction pyramid by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities simpler models that use handcrafted features such as gabor filters and support vector machines svms were a popular choice in the and because of artificial neural networks computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks both shallow and deep learning recurrent nets of anns for speech recognition have been explored for many years these methods never outperformed gaussian mixture markov model technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively key difficulties have been analyzed including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling an exception was at sri international in the late funded by the us government nsa and darpa sri studied deep neural networks dnns in speech and speaker recognition the speaker recognition team led by larry heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the national institute of standards and technology speaker recognition evaluation the sri deep neural network was then deployed in the nuance verifier representing the first major industrial application of deep learning the principle of elevating raw features over optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the raw spectrogram or linear features in the late showing its superiority over the features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms the raw features of speech waveforms later produced excellent results speech recognition was taken over by lstm in lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks in alex graves santiago fernández faustino gomez and schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification ctc in stacks of lstm rnns in google speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of through lstm which they made available through google voice search the impact of deep learning in industry began in the early when cnns already processed an estimated to of all the checks written in the us according to yann lecun industrial applications of deep learning to speech recognition started around in publications by geoff hinton ruslan salakhutdinov osindero and teh showed how a feedforward neural network could be effectively one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then it using supervised backpropagation the papers referred to learning for deep belief nets the nips workshop on deep learning for speech recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech and the possibility that given more capable hardware and data sets that deep neural nets might become practical it was believed that dnns using generative models of deep belief nets dbn would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets however it was discovered that replacing with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using dnns with large output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than gaussian mixture model gmm markov model hmm and also than generative systems the nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems analysis around contrasting the gmm and other generative speech models dnn models stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition that analysis was done with comparable performance less than in error rate between discriminative dnns and generative models in researchers extended deep learning from timit to large vocabulary speech recognition by adopting large output layers of the dnn based on hmm states constructed by decision trees deep learning is part of systems in various disciplines particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition asr results on commonly used evaluation sets such as timit asr and mnist image classification as well as a range of speech recognition tasks have steadily improved convolutional neural networks were superseded for asr by ctc for lstm but are more successful in computer vision advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning in nvidia was involved in what was called the big bang of deep learning as neural networks were trained with nvidia graphics processing units gpus that year andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of systems by about times in particular gpus are for the computations involved in machine learning gpus speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude reducing running times from weeks to days further specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models deep learning revolution in the late deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions in a long memory trained by connectionist temporal classification alex graves santiago fernández faustino gomez and jürgen schmidhuber was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition google later used lstm for speech recognition on the smartphone significant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from to although cnns trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and gpu implementations of nns for years including cnns faster implementations of cnns on gpus were needed to progress on computer vision in the dannet by dan ciresan ueli meier jonathan masci luca maria gambardella and jürgen schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest outperforming traditional methods by a factor of also in dannet won the icdar chinese handwriting contest and in may it won the isbi image segmentation contest until cnns did not play a major role at computer vision conferences but in june a paper by ciresan et al at the leading conference cvpr showed how cnns on gpu can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records in september dannet also won the icpr contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection and in the following year also the miccai grand challenge on the same topic in october the similar alexnet by alex krizhevsky ilya sutskever and geoffrey hinton won the imagenet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods the network by karen simonyan and andrew zisserman further reduced the error rate and won the imagenet competition following a similar trend in speech recognition image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions captions for images often as a combination of cnns and lstms in a team led by george dahl won the merck molecular activity challenge using deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug in sepp hochreiter group used deep learning to detect and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs and won the data challenge of nih fda and ncats in roger parloff mentioned a deep learning revolution that has transformed the ai industry in march yoshua bengio geoffrey hinton and yann lecun were awarded the turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing neural networks artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn progressively improve their ability to do tasks by considering examples generally without programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images they have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using programming an ann is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain each connection synapse between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron the receiving postsynaptic neuron can process the signal s and then signal downstream neurons connected to it neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between and neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream typically neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis as of neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans recognizing faces or playing go deep neural networks a deep neural network dnn is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers there are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components neurons synapses weights biases and functions these components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain and can be trained like any other ml algorithm for example a dnn that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed the user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display above a certain threshold etc and return the proposed label each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer and complex dnn have many layers hence the name deep networks dnns can model complex relationships dnn architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives the extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network for instance it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with dnns than with shallow networks deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches each architecture has found success in specific domains it is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets dnns are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back at first the dnn creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values or weights to connections between them the weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between and if the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern an algorithm would adjust the weights that way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data recurrent neural networks in which data can flow in any direction are used for applications such as language modeling long memory is particularly effective for this use convolutional neural networks cnns are used in computer vision cnns also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition asr challenges as with anns many issues can arise with naively trained dnns two common issues are overfitting and computation time dnns are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data regularization methods such as ivakhnenko unit pruning or weight decay ℓ or sparsity ℓ can be applied during training to combat overfitting alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training this helps to exclude rare dependencies finally data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting dnns must consider many training parameters such as the size number of layers and number of units per layer the learning rate and initial weights sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources various tricks such as batching computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples speed up computation large processing capabilities of architectures such as gpus or the intel xeon phi have produced significant speedups in training because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations alternatively engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms cmac cerebellar model articulation controller is one such kind of neural network it does require learning rates or randomized initial weights the training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved hardware since the advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of hidden units and a very large output layer by graphic processing units gpus often with enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training commercial cloud ai openai estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet to alphazero and found a increase in the amount of computation required with a trendline of months special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms deep learning processors include neural processing units npus in huawei cellphones and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units tpu in the

speech recognition automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning lstm rnns can learn very deep learning tasks that involve intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps where one time step corresponds to about lstm with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks the initial success in speech recognition was based on recognition tasks based on timit the data set contains speakers from eight major dialects of american english where each speaker reads sentences its small size lets many configurations be tried more importantly the timit task concerns recognition which unlike recognition allows weak phone bigram language models this lets the strength of the acoustic

dysmorphology novel analysis fdna used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes visual art processing closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks dnns have proven themselves capable for example of identifying the style period of a given painting neural style transfer capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields natural language processing neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early lstm helped to improve machine translation and language modeling other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding word embedding such as can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset the position is represented as a point in a vector space using word embedding as an rnn input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar a compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar pcfg

amino acids that make it up in alphafold a based system achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods deep neural network estimations deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called neural joint entropy estimator njee such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable practically the dnn is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix x to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable y given input x for example in image classification tasks the njee maps a vector of pixels color values to probabilities over possible image classes in practice the probability distribution of y is obtained by a softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of njee uses continuously differentiable activation functions such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds it is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes medical image analysis deep learning has

spinoff company deep longevity relation to human cognitive and brain development deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development specifically neocortical development proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early these developmental theories were instantiated in computational models making them predecessors of deep learning systems these developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain a wave of nerve growth factor support the somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models like the neocortex neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer or the operating environment and then passes its output and possibly the original input to other layers this process yields a stack of transducers to their operating environment a description stated the infant brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of different regions of the brain become connected sequentially with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature a variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective on the one hand several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks may be closer to biological reality in this respect generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about processing in the cerebral cortex although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established several analogies have been reported for example the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations similarly the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the and at the population levels commercial activity facebook ai lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them google deepmind technologies developed a

player google translate uses a neural network to translate between more than languages in was launched which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories as of researchers at the university of texas at austin ut developed a machine learning framework called training an agent manually via evaluative reinforcement or tamer which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor first developed as tamer a new algorithm called deep tamer was later introduced in during a collaboration between army research laboratory arl and ut researchers deep tamer used deep learning to provide a robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation using deep tamer a robot learned a task with a human trainer watching video streams or observing a human perform a task the robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer who provided feedback such as good job and bad job criticism and comment deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment in some cases from outside the field of computer science theory a main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using gradient descent however the theory surrounding other algorithms such as contrastive divergence is less clear does it converge if so how fast what is it approximating deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box with most confirmations done empirically rather than theoretically others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong ai not as an solution despite the power of deep learning methods they still lack much of the functionality needed to realize this goal entirely research psychologist gary marcus noted realistically deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge such as information about what objects are what they are for and how they are typically used the most powerful systems like watson use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques ranging from the statistical technique of bayesian inference to deductive reasoning in further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep layers neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal the original research notice received well over comments and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on the guardian website errors some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous artificial general intelligence agi architectures these issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to decompositions of observed entities and events learning a grammar visual or linguistic from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence ai cyber threat as deep learning moves from the lab into the world research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception by identifying patterns that these systems use to function attackers can modify inputs to anns in such a way that the ann finds a match that human observers would not recognize for example an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ann finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target such manipulation is termed an adversarial attack in researchers used one ann to doctor images in trial and error fashion identify another focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it the modified images looked no different to human eyes another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system one defense is reverse image search in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as tineye that can then find other instances of it a refinement is to search using only parts of the image to identify images from which that piece may have been taken another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities potentially allowing one person to impersonate another in researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ann to misclassify them anns can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry anns have been trained to defeat software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the while retaining its ability to damage the target in another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the google now voice command system open a particular web address and hypothesized that this could serve as a stepping stone for further attacks opening a web page hosting malware in data poisoning false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system training set to prevent it from achieving mastery data collection ethics most deep learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated annotated by humans it has been argued in media philosophy that not only clickwork on amazon mechanical turk is regularly deployed for this purpose but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such the philosopher rainer mühlhoff distinguishes five types of machinic capture of human microwork to generate training data gamification the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game trapping and tracking captchas for image recognition or on google search results pages exploitation of social motivations tagging faces on facebook to obtain labeled facial images information mining by leveraging devices such as activity trackers and clickwork mühlhoff argues that in most commercial applications of deep learning such as facebook face recognition system the need for training data does not stop once an ann is trained rather there is a continued demand for verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ann for this purpose facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image they receive a notification they can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image or tell facebook that it is not them in the picture this user interface is a mechanism to generate a constant stream of verification data to further train the network in as mühlhoff argues the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial applications of deep learning that such systems may be referred to as artificial intelligence see also applications of artificial intelligence comparison of deep learning software compressed sensing differentiable programming echo state network list of

references further reading computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring processing analyzing and understanding digital images and extraction of data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information in the forms of decisions understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input to the retina in the human analog into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action this image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry physics statistics and learning theory the scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images the image data can take many forms such as video sequences views from multiple cameras data from a scanner point clouds from lidar sensors or medical scanning devices the technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems of computer vision include scene reconstruction object detection event detection activity recognition video tracking object recognition pose estimation learning indexing motion estimation visual servoing scene modeling and image restoration adopting computer vision technology might be painstaking for organizations as there is no solution for it very few companies provide a unified and distributed platform or operating system where computer vision applications can be easily deployed and managed definition computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain understanding from digital images or videos from the perspective of engineering it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images it involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding as a scientific discipline computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images the image data can take many forms such as video sequences views from multiple cameras or data from a medical scanner as a technological discipline computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems machine vision refers to a systems engineering discipline especially in the context of factory automation in more recent times the terms computer vision and machine vision have converged to a greater degree history in the late computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence it was meant to mimic the human visual system as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior in it was believed that this could be achieved through an undergraduate summer project by attaching a camera to a computer and having it describe what it saw what distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding studies in the formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today including extraction of edges from images labeling of lines and polyhedral modeling representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures optical flow and motion estimation the next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision these include the concept of the inference of shape from various cues such as shading texture and focus and contour models known as snakes researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and markov random fields by the some of the previous research topics became more active than others research in projective reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration with the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry this led to methods for sparse reconstructions of scenes from multiple images progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further stereo techniques at the same time variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation this decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images see eigenface toward the end of the a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision this included rendering image morphing view interpolation panoramic image stitching and early rendering recent work has seen the resurgence of methods used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks the advancement of deep learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision the accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods related fields physics physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision most computer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible infrared or ultraviolet light the sensors are designed using quantum physics the process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process also various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision for example motion in fluids neurobiology neurobiology has greatly influenced the development of computer vision algorithms over the last century there has been an extensive study of eyes neurons and brain structures devoted to the processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals this has led to a coarse yet convoluted description of how natural vision systems operate in order to solve certain tasks these results have led to a within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems at different levels of complexity also some of the methods developed within computer vision neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification have their background in neurobiology the neocognitron a neural network developed in the by kunihiko fukushima is an early example of computer vision taking direct inspiration from neurobiology specifically the primary visual cortex some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological just as many strands of ai research are closely tied with research into human intelligence and the use of stored knowledge to interpret integrate and utilize visual information the field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals computer vision on the other hand develops and describes the algorithms implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems an interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields signal processing yet another field related to computer vision is signal processing many methods for processing signals typically temporal signals can be extended in a natural way to the processing of signals or signals in computer vision however because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in the processing of signals together with the of the signal this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision robotic navigation robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment a detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system acting as a vision sensor and providing information about the environment and the robot visual computing other fields besides the views on computer vision many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view for example many methods in computer vision are based on statistics optimization or geometry finally a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance computer vision is also used in fashion ecommerce inventory management patent search furniture and the beauty industry distinctions the fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing image analysis and machine vision there is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover this implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names on the other hand it appears to be necessary for research groups scientific journals conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and hence various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented in image processing the input is an image and the output is an image as well whereas in computer vision an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image an understanding of the content of an image or even behavior of a computer system based on such understanding computer graphics produces image data from models and computer vision often produces models from image data there is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines as explored in augmented reality the following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted image processing and image analysis tend to focus on images how to transform one image to another by operations such as contrast enhancement local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image this characterization implies that image neither requires assumptions nor produces interpretations about the image content computer vision includes analysis from images this analyzes the scene projected onto one or several images how to reconstruct structure or other information about the scene from one or several images computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide automatic inspection process control and robot guidance in industrial applications machine vision tends to focus on applications mainly in manufacturing robots and systems for inspection measurement or picking such as bin picking this implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that processing is emphasized by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software it also implies that external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision which can enable the use of different algorithms there is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images but sometimes also deals with the processing and analysis of images for example medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications finally pattern recognition is a field that uses various methods to extract information from signals in general mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks a significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision stereophotogrammetry computer stereo vision applications applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which say inspect bottles speeding by on a production line to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them the computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications in many applications computers are to solve a particular task but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common examples of applications of computer vision include systems for automatic inspection in manufacturing applications assisting humans in identification tasks a species identification system controlling processes an industrial robot detecting events for visual surveillance or people counting in the restaurant industry interaction as the input to a device for interaction modeling objects or environments medical image analysis or topographical modeling navigation by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robot organizing information for indexing databases of images and image sequences tracking surfaces or planes in coordinates for allowing augmented reality experiences medicine one of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision or medical image processing characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient an example of this is the detection of tumours arteriosclerosis or other malign changes and a variety of dental pathologies measurements of organ dimensions blood flow etc are another example it also supports medical research by providing new information about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by images or images for reduce the influence of noise machine vision a second application area in computer vision is in industry sometimes called machine vision where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process one example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects one of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the wafer industry in which every single wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner another example is a measurement of the position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm machine vision is also heavily used in the agricultural processes to remove undesirable foodstuff from bulk material a process called optical sorting military military applications are probably one of the largest areas of computer vision the obvious examples are the detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance more advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data modern military concepts such as battlefield awareness imply that various sensors including image sensors provide a rich set of information about a combat scene that can be used to support strategic decisions in this case automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability autonomous vehicles one of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles which include submersibles vehicles small robots with wheels cars or trucks aerial vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles uav the level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous unmanned vehicles to vehicles where systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation for knowing where they are or mapping their environment slam for detecting obstacles it can also be used for detecting certain events a uav looking for forest fires examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars cameras and lidar sensors in vehicles and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars there are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to uavs for recon missions or missile guidance space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision nasa curiosity and cnsa rover tactile feedback materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting microundulations and calibrating robotic hands rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges the finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins a user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface a computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins are being pushed upward if a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface this sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data on imperfections on a very large surface another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon the silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced these cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data other application areas include support of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast camera tracking match moving surveillance driver drowsiness detection tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences typical tasks each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less measurement problems or processing problems which can be solved using a variety of methods some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring processing analyzing and understanding digital images and extraction of data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information in the forms of decisions understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images the input of the retina into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action this image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry physics statistics and learning theory recognition the classical problem in computer vision image processing and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object feature or activity different varieties of recognition problem are described in the literature object recognition also called object classification one or several or learned objects or object classes can be recognized usually together with their positions in the image or poses in the scene blippar google goggles and likethat provide programs that illustrate this functionality identification an individual instance of an object is recognized examples include identification of a specific person face or fingerprint identification of handwritten digits or the identification of a specific vehicle detection the image data are scanned for specific objects along with their locations examples include the detection of an obstacle in the car field of view and possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or the detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation currently the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks an illustration of their capabilities is given by the imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge this is a benchmark in object classification and detection with millions of images and object classes used in the competition performance of convolutional neural networks on the imagenet tests is now close to that of humans the best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin such as a small ant on the stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand they also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras by contrast those kinds of images rarely trouble humans humans however tend to have trouble with other issues for example they are not good at classifying objects into classes such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease several specialized tasks based on recognition exist such as image retrieval finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content the content can be specified in different ways for example in terms of similarity relative to a target image give me all images similar to image x by utilizing reverse image search techniques or in terms of search criteria given as text input give me all images which contain many houses are taken during winter and have no cars in them pose estimation estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera an example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin optical character recognition ocr identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing ascii a related task is reading of codes such as data matrix and qr codes facial recognition a technology that enables the matching of faces in digital images or video frames to a face database which is now widely used for mobile phone facelock smart door locking etc emotion recognition a subset of facial recognition emotion recognition refers to the process of classifying human emotions psychologists caution however that internal emotions can not be reliably detected from faces shape recognition technology srt in people counter systems differentiating human beings head and shoulder patterns from objects human activity recognition deals with recognizing the activity from a series of video frames such as if the person is picking up an object or walking motion analysis several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the scene or even of the camera that produces the images examples of such tasks are egomotion determining the rigid motion rotation and translation of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera tracking following the movements of a usually smaller set of interest points or objects vehicles objects humans or other organisms in the image sequence this has vast industry applications as most machinery can be monitored in this way optical flow to determine for each point in the image how that point is moving relative to the image plane its apparent motion this motion is a result of both how the corresponding point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene scene reconstruction given one or typically more images of a scene or a video scene reconstruction aims at computing a model of the scene in the simplest case the model can be a set of points more sophisticated methods produce a complete surface model the advent of imaging not requiring motion or scanning and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field sensing can be used to acquire images from multiple angles algorithms are now available to stitch multiple images together into point clouds and models image restoration image restoration comes into the picture when the original image is degraded or damaged due to some external factors like lens wrong positioning transmission interference low lighting or motion blurs which is referred to as noise when the images are degraded or damaged the information to be extracted from them also gets damaged therefore we need to recover or restore the image as it was intended to be the aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise motion blur etc from images the simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as filters or median filters more sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look to distinguish them from noise by first analyzing the image data in terms of the local image structures such as lines or edges and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches an example in this field is inpainting system methods the organization of a computer vision system is highly some systems are applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem while others constitute a of a larger design which for example also contains for control of mechanical actuators planning information databases interfaces etc the specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation many functions are unique to the application there are however typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems image acquisition a digital image is produced by one or several image sensors which besides various types of cameras include range sensors tomography devices radar cameras etc depending on the type of sensor the resulting image data is an ordinary image a volume or an image sequence the pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands gray images or colour images but can also be related to various physical measures such as depth absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves or magnetic resonance imaging before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information it is usually necessary to process the data in order to ensure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method examples are to ensure that the image coordinate system is correct noise reduction to ensure that sensor noise does not introduce false information contrast enhancement to ensure that relevant information can be detected scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales feature extraction image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data typical examples of such features are lines edges and ridges localized interest points such as corners blobs or points more complex features may be related to texture shape or motion at some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing examples are selection of a specific set of interest points segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground object groups single objects or salient object parts also referred to as scene hierarchy while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention segmentation or of one or multiple videos into a series of foreground masks while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity processing at this step the input is typically a small set of data for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object the remaining processing deals with for example verification that the data satisfies and assumptions estimation of parameters such as object pose or object size image recognition classifying a detected object into different categories image registration comparing and combining two different views of the same object decision making making the final decision required for the application for example on automatic inspection applications in recognition applications flag for further human review in medical military security and recognition applications systems systems ius include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges texture elements or regions intermediate level includes boundaries surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects scenes or events many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research the representational requirements in the designing of ius for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts concept organization spatial knowledge temporal knowledge scaling and description by comparison and differentiation while inference refers to the process of deriving new not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference search and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing inference and control requirements for ius are search and hypothesis activation matching and hypothesis testing generation and use of expectations change and focus of attention certainty and strength of belief inference and goal satisfaction hardware there are many kinds of computer vision systems however all of them contain these basic elements a power source at least one image acquisition device camera ccd etc a processor and control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism in addition a practical vision system contains software as well as a display in order to monitor the system vision systems for inner spaces as most industrial ones contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment furthermore a completed system includes many accessories such as camera supports cables and connectors most computer vision systems use cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most frames per second usually far slower a few computer vision systems use hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both such as scanners thermographic cameras hyperspectral imagers radar imaging lidar scanners magnetic resonance images sonar synthetic aperture sonar etc such hardware captures images that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process images while traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of frames per second advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made image acquisition processing and display possible for systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second for applications in robotics fast video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms when combined with a projector fast image acquisition allows measurement and feature tracking to be realized

used by researchers universities private companies as well as the a neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another neurons can be either biological cells or mathematical models while individual neurons are simple many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks there are two main types of neural network in neuroscience a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems a population of nerve cells connected by synapses in machine learning an artificial neural network is a mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions artificial neural networks are used to solve artificial intelligence problems in biology in the context of biology a neural network is a population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses a given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses each neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors a neuron can serve an excitatory role amplifying and propagating signals it receives or an inhibitory role suppressing signals instead populations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits very large interconnected networks are called large scale brain networks and many of these together form brains and nervous systems signals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells where they cause contraction and thereby motion in machine learning in the context of machine learning a neural network is an artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions while early artificial neural networks were physical machines today they are almost always implemented in software neurons in an artificial neural network are usually arranged into layers with information passing from the first layer the input layer through one or more intermediate layers hidden layers to the final layer the output layer the signal input to each neuron is a number specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer the signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number according to its activation function the behavior of the network depends on the strengths or weights of the connections between neurons a network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation in order to fit some preexisting dataset neural networks are used to solve problems in artificial intelligence and have thereby found applications in many disciplines including predictive modeling adaptive control facial recognition handwriting recognition general game playing and generative ai history the theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by alexander bain in and william james in both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain in donald hebb described hebbian learning the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the under the approach of connectionism however starting with the invention of the perceptron a simple artificial neural network by warren mcculloch and walter pitts in followed by the implementation of one in hardware by frank rosenblatt in artificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead and increasingly different from their biological counterparts see also emergence biological cybernetics computing references reinforcement learning rl is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled pairs to be presented and in not needing actions to be explicitly corrected instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration of uncharted territory and exploitation of current knowledge with the goal of maximizing the long term reward whose feedback might be incomplete or delayed the environment is typically stated in the form of a markov decision process mdp because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques the main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the markov decision process and they target large markov decision processes where exact methods become infeasible introduction due to its generality reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory optimization systems swarm intelligence and statistics in the operations research and control literature reinforcement learning is called approximate dynamic programming or programming the problems of interest in reinforcement learning have also been studied in the theory of optimal control which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions and algorithms for their exact computation and less with learning or approximation particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a markov decision process a set of environment and agent states s s a set of actions a a of the agent p a s s pr s t s s t s a t a a s s t t the probability of transition at time t t from state s s to state s s under action a a r a s s a s s the immediate reward after transition from s s to s s with action a a the purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal or policy that maximizes the reward function or other reinforcement signal that accumulates from the immediate rewards this is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology see reinforcement for example biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements in some circumstances animals can learn to engage in behaviors that optimize these rewards this suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning a basic reinforcement learning agent ai interacts with its environment in discrete time steps at each time t the agent receives the current state s t t and reward r t t it then chooses an action a t t from the set of available actions which is subsequently sent to the environment the environment moves to a new state s t and the reward r t associated with the transition s t a t s t t t is determined the goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn a policy π s a s a π s a pr a t a s t s s a t t that maximizes the expected cumulative reward formulating the problem as an markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state in this case the problem is said to have full observability if the agent only has access to a subset of states or if the observed states are corrupted by noise the agent is said to have partial observability and formally the problem must be formulated as a partially observable markov decision process in both cases the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted for example the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive if the current value of the state is and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by the transition will not be allowed when the agent performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally the difference in performance gives rise to the notion of regret in order to act near optimally the agent must reason about the consequences of its actions maximize future income although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative thus reinforcement learning is particularly to problems that include a versus reward it has been applied successfully to various problems including energy storage operation robot control photovoltaic generators dispatch backgammon checkers go alphago and autonomous driving systems two elements make reinforcement learning powerful the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments thanks to these two key components reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations a model of the environment is known but an analytic solution is not available only a simulation model of the environment is given the subject of optimization the only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it the first two of these problems could be considered planning problems since some form of model is available while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem however reinforcement learning converts both planning problems to machine learning problems exploration the exploration exploitation has been most thoroughly studied through the bandit problem and for finite state space markov decision processes in burnetas and katehakis reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms randomly selecting actions without reference to an estimated probability distribution shows poor performance the case of small finite markov decision processes is relatively well understood however due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states or scale to problems with infinite state spaces simple exploration methods are the most practical one such method is ε where ε is a parameter controlling the amount of exploration exploitation with probability ε exploitation is chosen and the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best effect ties between actions are broken uniformly at random alternatively with probability ε exploration is chosen and the action is chosen uniformly at random ε is usually a fixed parameter but can be adjusted either according to a schedule making the agent explore progressively less or adaptively based on heuristics algorithms for control learning even if the issue of exploration is disregarded and even if the state was observable assumed hereafter the problem remains to use past experience to find out which actions lead to higher cumulative rewards criterion of optimality policy the agent action selection is modeled as a map called policy π a s a s π a s pr a t a s t s a s t t the policy map gives the probability of taking action a a when in state s s there are also deterministic policies function the function v π s s is defined as expected discounted return starting with state s s s s and successively following policy π hence roughly speaking the value function estimates how good it is to be in a given state v π s e g s s e t γ t r t s s s e e t where the random variable g g denotes the discounted return and is defined as the sum of future discounted rewards g t γ t r t r γ r γ r t where r t is the reward for transitioning from state s t t to s t γ is the discount rate γ is less than so rewards in the distant future are weighted less than rewards in the immediate future the algorithm must find a policy with maximum expected discounted return from the theory of markov decision processes it is known that without loss of generality the search can be restricted to the set of stationary policies a policy is stationary if the returned by it depends only on the last state visited from the observation agent history the search can be further restricted to deterministic stationary policies a deterministic stationary policy deterministically selects actions based on the current state since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality brute force the brute force approach entails two steps for each possible policy sample returns while following it choose the policy with the largest expected discounted return one problem with this is that the number of policies can be large or even infinite another is that the variance of the returns may be large which requires many samples to accurately estimate the discounted return of each policy these problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others the two main approaches for achieving this are value function estimation and direct policy search value function value function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the discounted return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected discounted returns e g e g for some policy usually either the current or the optimal one these methods rely on the theory of markov decision processes where optimality is defined in a sense stronger than the one above a policy is optimal if it achieves the discounted return from any initial state initial distributions play no role in this definition again an optimal policy can always be found among stationary policies to define optimality in a formal manner define the of a policy π by v π s e g s π s e s where g g stands for the discounted return associated with following π from the initial state s s defining v s s as the maximum possible of v π s s where π is allowed to change v s max π v π s s s a policy that achieves these optimal in each state is called optimal clearly a policy that is optimal in this strong sense is also optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected discounted return ρ π since ρ π e v π s e s where s s is a state randomly sampled from the distribution μ of initial states so μ s pr s s s although suffice to define optimality it is useful to define given a state s s an action a a and a policy π the of the pair s a s a under π is defined by q π s a e g s a π s a e s a where g g now stands for the random discounted return associated with first taking action a a in state s s and following π thereafter the theory of markov decision processes states that if π is an optimal policy we act optimally take the optimal action by choosing the action from q π s s with the highest at each state s s the function of such an optimal policy q π is called the optimal function and is commonly denoted by q in summary the knowledge of the optimal function alone suffices to know how to act optimally assuming full knowledge of the markov decision process the two basic approaches to compute the optimal function are value iteration and policy iteration both algorithms compute a sequence of functions q k k k that converge to q computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole which is impractical for all but the smallest finite markov decision processes in reinforcement learning methods expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large spaces monte carlo methods monte carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration policy iteration consists of two steps policy evaluation and policy improvement monte carlo is used in the policy evaluation step in this step given a stationary deterministic policy π the goal is to compute the function values q π s a s a or a good approximation to them for all pairs s a s a assume for simplicity that the markov decision process is finite that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state then the estimate of the value of a given pair s a s a can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from s a s a over time given sufficient time this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate q q of the function q π this finishes the description of the policy evaluation step in the policy improvement step the next policy is obtained by computing a greedy policy with respect to q q given a state s s this new policy returns an action that maximizes q s q s in practice lazy evaluation can defer the computation of the maximizing actions to when they are needed problems with this procedure include the procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy it uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the single pair that started the trajectory when the returns along the trajectories have high variance convergence is slow it works in episodic problems only it works in small finite markov decision processes only temporal difference methods the first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy at some or all states before the values settle this too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence most current algorithms do this giving rise to the class of generalized policy iteration algorithms many methods belong to this category the second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any pair in them this may also help to some extent with the third problem although a better solution when returns have high variance is sutton temporal difference td methods that are based on the recursive bellman equation the computation in td methods can be incremental when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away or batch when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch batch methods such as the temporal difference method may use the information in the samples better while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity some methods try to combine the two approaches methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue another problem specific to td comes from their reliance on the recursive bellman equation most td methods have a λ parameter λ that can continuously interpolate between monte carlo methods that do not rely on the bellman equations and the basic td methods that rely entirely on the bellman equations this can be effective in palliating this issue function approximation methods in order to address the fifth issue function approximation methods are used linear function approximation starts with a mapping ϕ that assigns a vector to each pair then the action values of a pair s a s a are obtained by linearly combining the components of ϕ s a s a with some weights θ q s a i d θ i ϕ i s a q s a d i i s a the algorithms then adjust the weights instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual pairs methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics which can be seen to construct their own features have been explored value iteration can also be used as a starting point giving rise to the algorithm and its many variants including deep methods when a neural network is used to represent q with various applications in stochastic search problems the problem with using is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods using the compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency direct policy search an alternative method is to search directly in some subset of the policy space in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization the two approaches available are and methods methods policy gradient methods start with a mapping from a parameter space to the space of policies given the parameter vector θ let π θ denote the policy associated to θ defining the performance function by ρ θ ρ π θ under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector θ if the gradient of ρ was known one could use gradient ascent since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available only a noisy estimate is available such an estimate can be constructed in many ways giving rise to algorithms such as williams reinforce method which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the optimization literature a large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information these include simulated annealing search or methods of evolutionary computation many methods can achieve in theory and in the limit a global optimum policy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data for example this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case in recent years methods have been proposed and performed well on various problems policy search methods have been used in the robotics context many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima as they are based on local search algorithms finally all of the above methods can be combined with algorithms that first learn a model of the markov decision process the probability of each next state given an action taken from an existing state for instance the dyna algorithm learns a model from experience and uses that to provide more modelled transitions for a value function in addition to the real transitions such methods can sometimes be extended to use of models such as when the transitions are simply stored and to the learning algorithm methods can be more computationally intensive than approaches and their utility can be limited by the extent to which the markov decision process can be learnt there are other ways to use models than to update a value function for instance in model predictive control the model is used to update the behavior directly theory both the asymptotic and behaviors of most algorithms are well understood algorithms with provably good online performance addressing the exploration issue are known efficient exploration of markov decision processes is given in burnetas and katehakis performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations for incremental algorithms asymptotic convergence issues have been settled algorithms converge under a wider set of conditions than was previously possible for example when used with arbitrary smooth function

this approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space the work on learning atari games by google deepmind increased attention to deep reinforcement learning or reinforcement learning adversarial deep reinforcement learning adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies in this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations while some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies fuzzy reinforcement learning by introducing fuzzy inference in reinforcement learning approximating the value function with fuzzy rules in continuous space becomes possible the if then form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language extending frl with fuzzy rule interpolation allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy to emphasize cardinal rules most important values inverse reinforcement learning in inverse reinforcement learning irl no reward function is given instead the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert the idea is to mimic observed behavior which is often optimal or close to optimal one popular irl paradigm is named maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning maxent irl maxent irl estimates the parameters of a linear model of the reward function by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution of observed trajectories subject to constraints related to matching expected feature counts recently it has been shown that maxent irl is a particular case of a more general framework named random utility inverse reinforcement learning is based on random utility theory and markov decision processes while prior irl approaches assume that the apparent random behavior of an observed agent is due to it following a random policy assumes that the observed agent follows a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer only has partial access to the features the observed agent uses in decision making the utility function is modeled as a random variable to account for the ignorance of the observer regarding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function safe reinforcement learning safe reinforcement learning srl can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it

on reinforcement learning dissecting reinforcement learning series of blog post on reinforcement learning with python code a long peek into reinforcement learning big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional application software data with many entries rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate though used sometimes loosely partly due to a lack of formal definition the best interpretation is that it is a large body of information that can not be comprehended when used in small amounts only big data analysis challenges include capturing data data storage data analysis search sharing transfer visualization querying updating information privacy and data source big data was originally associated with three key concepts volume variety and velocity the analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling thus a fourth concept veracity refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization capacity to create and capture value from big data current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics user behavior analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data and seldom to a particular size of data set there is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large but that not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem analysis of data sets can find new correlations to spot business trends prevent diseases combat crime and so on scientists business executives medical practitioners advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large in areas including internet searches fintech healthcare analytics geographic information systems urban informatics and business informatics scientists encounter limitations in work including meteorology genomics connectomics complex physics simulations biology and environmental research the size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices cheap and numerous internet of things devices aerial remote sensing equipment software logs cameras microphones identification rfid readers and wireless sensor networks the world technological capacity to store information has roughly doubled every months since the as of every day exabytes bytes of data are generated based on an idc report prediction the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially

efficiency improvements alone by using big data and users of services enabled by data could capture billion in consumer surplus one question for large enterprises is determining who should own initiatives that affect the entire organization relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data the processing and analysis of big data may require massively parallel software running on tens hundreds or even thousands of servers what qualifies as big data varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools furthermore expanding capabilities make big data a moving target for some organizations facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options for others it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration definition the term big data has been in use since the with some giving credit to john mashey for popularizing the term big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture curate manage and process data within a tolerable elapsed time big data philosophy encompasses unstructured and structured data however the main focus is on unstructured data big data size is a constantly moving target as of ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from that are diverse complex and of a massive scale variety veracity and various other vs are added by some organizations to describe it a revision challenged by some industry authorities the vs of big data were often referred to as the three vs four vs and five vs they represented the qualities of big data in volume variety velocity veracity and value variability is often included as an additional quality of big data a definition states big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data and notes this represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used via parallel programming theories and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by codd relational model in a comparative study of big datasets kitchin and mcardle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases for this reason other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait instead of focusing on the intrinsic characteristics of big data this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected stored made available and analyzed big data business intelligence the growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between big data and business intelligence business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things detect trends etc big data uses mathematical analysis optimization inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification to infer laws regressions nonlinear relationships and causal effects from large sets of data with low information density to reveal relationships and dependencies or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors characteristics big data can be described by the following characteristics volume the quantity of generated and stored data the size of the data determines the value and potential insight and whether it can be considered big data or not the size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes variety the type and nature of the data earlier technologies like rdbmss were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively however the change in type and nature from structured to or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture store and process the and unstructured variety data generated with high speed velocity and huge in size volume later these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage eventually the processing of structured data was still kept as optional either using big data or traditional rdbmss this helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media log files sensors etc big data draws from text images audio video plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion velocity the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development big data is often available in compared to small data big data is produced more continually two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling recording and publishing veracity the truthfulness or reliability of the data which refers to the data quality and the data value big data must not only be large in size but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it the data quality of captured data can vary greatly affecting an accurate analysis value the worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data variability the characteristic of the changing formats structure or sources of big data big data can include structured unstructured or combinations of structured and unstructured data big data analysis may integrate raw data from multiple sources the processing of raw data may also involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data other possible characteristics of big data are exhaustive whether the entire system n n is captured or recorded or not big data may or may not include all the available data from sources and uniquely lexical respectively the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified relational if the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining or of different data sets extensional if new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily scalability if the size of the big data storage system can expand rapidly architecture big data repositories have existed in many forms often built by corporations with a special need commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the for many years wintercorp published the largest database report teradata corporation in marketed the parallel processing dbc system teradata systems were the first to store and analyze terabyte of data in hard disk drives were gb in so the definition of big data continuously evolves teradata installed the first petabyte class rdbms based system in as of there are a few dozen petabyte class teradata relational databases installed the largest of which exceeds pb systems up until were structured relational data since then teradata has added unstructured data types including xml json and avro in seisint now lexisnexis risk solutions developed a distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the hpcc systems platform this system automatically partitions distributes stores and delivers structured and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ecl data analysts working in ecl are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution in lexisnexis acquired seisint and their parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of choicepoint when they acquired that company in in the hpcc systems platform was under the apache license cern and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades usually analyzed via computing rather than the architectures usually meant by the current big data movement in google published a paper on a process called mapreduce that uses a similar architecture the mapreduce concept provides a parallel processing model and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data with mapreduce queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel the map step the results are then gathered and delivered the reduce step the framework was very successful so others wanted to replicate the algorithm therefore an implementation of the mapreduce framework was adopted by an apache project named hadoop apache spark was developed in in response to limitations in the mapreduce paradigm as it adds processing and the ability to set up many operations not just map followed by reducing is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled big data solution offering the methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources complexity in interrelationships and difficulty in deleting or modifying individual records studies in showed that a architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents a distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds this type of architecture inserts data into a parallel dbms which implements the use of mapreduce and hadoop frameworks this type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the by using a application server the data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management this enables quick segregation of data into the data lake thereby reducing the overhead time technologies a mckinsey global institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows techniques for analyzing data such as testing machine learning and natural language processing big data technologies like business intelligence cloud computing and databases visualization such as charts graphs and other displays of the data multidimensional big data can also be represented as olap data cubes or mathematically tensors array database systems have set out to provide storage and query support on this data type additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient computation such as multilinear subspace learning massively mpp databases applications data mining distributed file systems distributed cache burst buffer and memcached distributed databases cloud and infrastructure applications storage and computing resources and the internet although many approaches and technologies have been developed it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data some mpp relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data implicit is the ability to load monitor back up and optimize the use of the large data tables in the rdbms darpa topological data analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in the technology went public with the launch of a company called ayasdi the practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage preferring storage das in its various forms from solid state drive ssd to high capacity sata disk buried inside parallel processing nodes the perception of shared storage area network san and storage nas is that they are relatively slow complex and expensive these qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance commodity infrastructure and low cost real or information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible data in memory or disk is on memory or disk at the other end of an fc san connection is not the cost of an san at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques applications big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that software ag oracle corporation ibm microsoft sap emc hp and dell have spent more than billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics in this industry was worth more than billion and was growing at almost percent a year about twice as fast as the software business as a whole developed economies increasingly use technologies there are billion subscriptions worldwide and between billion and billion people accessing the internet between and more than billion people worldwide entered the middle class which means more people became more literate which in turn led to information growth the world effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was petabytes in petabytes in exabytes in exabytes in and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at exabytes annually by according to one estimate of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data which is the format most useful for most big data applications this also shows the potential of yet unused data in the form of video and audio content while many vendors offer products for big data experts promote the development of systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities government the use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost productivity and innovation but does not come without its flaws data analysis often requires multiple parts of government central and local to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome a common government organization that makes use of big data is the national security administration nsa which monitors the activities of the internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up civil registration and vital statistics crvs collects all certificates status from birth to death crvs is a source of big data for governments international development research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development also known as suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development advancements in big data analysis offer opportunities to improve in critical development areas such as health care employment economic productivity crime security and natural disaster and resource management additionally data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice however longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy imperfect methodology and interoperability issues the challenge of big data for development is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning known as artificial intelligence for development benefits a major practical application of big data for development has been fighting poverty with data in blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata and in jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in latin america hilbert and colleagues argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as thematic coverage including areas that were previously difficult or impossible to measure geographical coverage providing sizable and comparable data for almost all countries including many small countries that usually are not included in international inventories level of detail providing data with many interrelated variables and new aspects like network connections timeliness and timeseries graphs can be produced within days of being collected challenges at the same time working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis priorities change but the basic discussions remain the same among the main challenges are representativeness while traditional development statistics is mainly concerned with the representativeness of random survey samples digital trace data is never a random sample generalizability while observational data always represents this source very well it only represents what it represents and nothing more while it is tempting to generalize from specific observations of one platform to broader settings this is often very deceptive harmonization digital trace data still requires international harmonization of indicators it adds the challenge of the harmonization of different sources data overload analysts and institutions are not used to effectively deal with a large number of variables which is efficiently done with interactive dashboards practitioners still lack a standard workflow that would allow researchers users and policymakers to efficiently and effectively deal with data finance big data is being rapidly adopted in finance to speed up processing and deliver better more informed inferences both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions the financial applications of big data range from investing decisions and trading processing volumes of available price data limit order books economic data and more all at the same time portfolio management optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments potentially selected from different asset classes risk management credit rating based on extended information and any other aspect where the data inputs are large healthcare big data analytics has been used in healthcare in providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics waste and care variability reduction automated external and internal reporting of patient data standardized medical terms and patient registries some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented the level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial with the added adoption of mhealth ehealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase this includes electronic health record data imaging data patient generated data sensor data and other forms of difficult to process data there is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality big data very often means data and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed while extensive information in healthcare is now electronic it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use the use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights privacy and autonomy to transparency and trust big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research as analysis can move forward more quickly than research then trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional follow up biological research and eventually clinical research a related application that heavily relies on big data within the healthcare field is that of diagnosis in medicine for instance for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create to gb of data daily similarly a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages mb of data these are just a few of the many examples where diagnosis uses big data for this reason big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance education a mckinsey global institute study found a shortage of million highly trained data professionals and managers and a number of universities including university of tennessee and uc berkeley have created masters programs to meet this demand private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand including free programs like the data incubator or paid programs like general assembly in the specific field of marketing one of the problems stressed by wedel and kannan is that marketing has several sub domains advertising promotions product development branding that all use different types of data media to understand how the media uses big data it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process it has been suggested by nick couldry and joseph turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals the industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers magazines or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations the ultimate aim is to serve or convey a message or content that is statistically speaking in line with the consumer mindset for example publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages advertisements and content articles to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various activities targeting of consumers for advertising by marketers data capture data journalism publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics channel the british television broadcaster is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis insurance health insurance providers are collecting data on social determinants of health such as food and tv consumption marital status clothing size and purchasing habits from which they make predictions on health costs in order to spot health issues in their clients it is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing internet of things iot big data and the iot work in conjunction data extracted from iot devices provides a mapping of device such mappings have been used by the media industry companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency the iot is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data and this sensory data has been used in medical manufacturing and transportation contexts kevin ashton the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term defines the internet of things in this quote if we had computers that knew everything there was to know about data they gathered without any help from would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste loss and cost we would know when things needed replacing repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best information technology especially since big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology it the use of big data to resolve it and data collection issues within an enterprise is called it operations analytics itoa by applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing it departments can predict potential issues and prevent them itoa businesses offer platforms for systems management that bring data silos together and generate insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data survey science compared to data collection big data has low cost per data point applies analysis techniques via machine learning and data mining and includes diverse and new data sources registers social media apps and other forms digital data since survey scientists have started to examine how big data and survey science can complement each other to allow researchers and practitioners to improve the production of statistics and its quality to date there have been three big data meets survey science bigsurv conferences in virtual and as of one conference forthcoming in a special issue in the social science computer review a special issue in journal of the royal statistical society and a special issue in ep j data science and a book called big data meets social sciences edited by craig hill and five other fellows of the american statistical association in the founding members of bigsurv received the warren mitofsky innovators award from the american association for public opinion research marketing big data is notable in marketing due to the constant datafication of everyday consumers of the internet in which all forms of data are tracked the datafication of consumers can be defined as quantifying many of or all human behaviors for the purpose of marketing the increasingly digital world of rapid datafication makes this idea relevant to marketing because the amount of data constantly grows exponentially it is predicted to increase from to zettabytes within the span of five years the size of big data can often be difficult to navigate for marketers as a result adopters of big data may find themselves at a disadvantage algorithmic findings can be difficult to achieve with such large datasets big data in marketing is a highly lucrative tool that can be used for large corporations its value being as a result of the possibility of predicting significant trends interests or statistical outcomes in a manner there are three significant factors in the use of big data in marketing big data provides customer behavior pattern spotting for marketers since all human actions are being quantified into readable numbers for marketers to analyze and use for their research market responsiveness is important for marketers because of the ability to shift marketing efforts and correct to current trends which is helpful in maintaining relevance to consumers this can supply corporations with the information necessary to predict the wants and needs of consumers in advance market ambidexterity are being highly fueled by big data new models and algorithms are being developed to make significant predictions about certain economic and social situations case studies government china the integrated joint operations

of uses of big data in public services data on prescription drugs by connecting origin location and the time of each prescription a research unit was able to exemplify and examine the considerable delay between the release of any given drug and a adaptation of the national institute for health and care excellence guidelines this suggests that new or most drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient joining up data a local authority blended data about services such as road gritting rotas with services for people at risk such as meals on wheels the connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any delay united states in the obama administration announced the big data research and development initiative to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government the initiative is composed of different big data programs spread across six departments big data analysis played a large role in barack obama successful campaign the united states federal government owns four of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world the utah data center has been constructed by the united states national security agency when finished the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the nsa over the internet the exact amount of storage space is unknown but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few exabytes this has posed security concerns regarding the anonymity of the data collected retail walmart handles more than million customer transactions every hour which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than petabytes terabytes of equivalent of times the information contained in all the books in the us library of congress windermere real estate uses location information from nearly million drivers to help new home buyers determine their typical drive times to and from work throughout various times of the day fico card detection system protects accounts worldwide science the large hadron collider experiments represent about million sensors delivering data million times per second there are nearly million collisions per second after filtering and refraining from recording more than of these streams there are collisions of interest per second as a result only working with less than of the sensor stream data the data flow from all four lhc experiments represents petabytes annual rate before replication as of this becomes nearly petabytes after replication if all sensor data were recorded in lhc the data flow would be extremely hard to work with the data flow would exceed million petabytes annual rate or nearly exabytes per day before replication to put the number in perspective this is equivalent to quintillion bytes per day almost times more than all the other sources combined in the world the square kilometre array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas it is expected to be operational by collectively these antennas are expected to gather exabytes and store one petabyte per day it is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken when the sloan digital sky survey sdss began to collect astronomical data in it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously continuing at a rate of about gb per night sdss has amassed more than terabytes of information when the large synoptic survey telescope successor to sdss comes online in its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days decoding the human genome originally took years to process now it can be achieved in less than a day the dna sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by in the last ten years which is times less expensive than the reduction

linked to depression in database lead to a surge in demands to access the repository with fielding nearly requests to access the depression data in the two weeks after publication of the paper computational fluid dynamics cfd and hydrodynamic turbulence research generate massive data sets the johns hopkins turbulence databases jhtdb contains over terabytes of spatiotemporal fields from direct numerical simulations of various turbulent flows such data have been difficult to share using traditional methods such as downloading flat simulation output files the data within jhtdb can be accessed using virtual sensors with various access modes ranging from direct queries access through matlab python fortran and c programs executing on clients platforms to cut out services to download raw data the data have been used in over scientific publications sports big data can be used to improve training and understanding competitors using sport sensors it is also possible to predict winners in a match using big data analytics future performance of players could be predicted as well thus players value and salary is determined by data collected throughout the season in formula one races race cars with hundreds of sensors generate terabytes of data these sensors collect data points from tire pressure to fuel burn efficiency based on the data engineers and data analysts decide

handles billion photos from its user base as of june facebook reached billion monthly active users google was handling roughly billion searches per month as of august during the pandemic big data was raised as a way to minimise the impact of the disease significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus case identification and development of medical treatment governments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread early adopters included china taiwan south korea and israel research activities encrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in march at the american society of engineering education gautam siwach engaged at tackling the challenges of big data by mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and amir esmailpour at the unh research group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections they focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and examples within the technology moreover they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data in march the white house announced a national big data initiative that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than million to big data research projects the initiative included a national science foundation expeditions in computing grant of million over five years to the amplab at the university of california berkeley the amplab also received funds from darpa and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion to fighting cancer the white house big data initiative also included a commitment by the department of energy to provide million in funding over five years to establish the scalable data management analysis and visualization sdav institute led by the energy department lawrence berkeley national laboratory the sdav institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the department supercomputers the state of massachusetts announced the massachusetts big data initiative in may which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions the massachusetts institute of technology hosts the intel science and technology center for big data in the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory combining government corporate and institutional funding and research efforts the european commission is funding the big data public private forum through their seventh framework program to engage companies academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues the project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the european commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy outcomes of this project will be used as input for horizon their next framework program the british government announced in march the founding of the alan turing institute named after the computer pioneer and which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets at the university of waterloo stratford campus canadian open data experience code inspiration day participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world computational social sciences anyone can use application programming interfaces apis provided by big data holders such as google and twitter to do research in the social and behavioral sciences often these apis are provided for free tobias preis et al used google trends data to demonstrate that internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products gdps are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past the findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and economic indicators the authors of the study examined google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year to the volume of searches for the previous year which they call the future orientation index they compared the future orientation index to the per capita gdp of each country and found a strong tendency for countries where google users inquire more about the future to have a higher gdp tobias preis and his colleagues helen susannah moat and eugene stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by google trends their analysis of google search volume for terms of varying financial relevance published in scientific reports suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist hence there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways sampling big data a research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough the name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data but sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population in manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics vibration pressure current voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals to predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic psychographic behavioral and transactional data with large sets of data points marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting critique critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors those that question the implications of the approach itself and those that question the way it is currently done one approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies critiques of the big data paradigm a crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical that lead to the emergence of the se typical network characteristics of big data in their critique snijders matzat and reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of mark graham has leveled broad critiques at chris anderson assertion that big data will spell the end of theory focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social economic and political contexts even as companies invest and sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers less than of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so to overcome this insight deficit big data no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed must be complemented by big judgment according to an article in the harvard business review much in the same line it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably informed by the world as it was in the past or at best as it currently is fed by a large number of data on past experiences algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past if the system dynamics of the future change if it is not a stationary process the past can say little about the future in order to make predictions in changing environments it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic which requires theory as a response to this critique alemany oliver and vayre suggest to use abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers digital traces and make new theories emerge additionally it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations such as models and complex systems models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms finally the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data such as factor analysis and cluster analysis have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the approaches contingency tables typically employed with smaller data sets in health and biology conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation for these approaches the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis a new postulate is accepted now in biosciences the information provided by the data in huge volumes omics without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation in the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor the search logic is reversed and the limits of induction glory of science and philosophy scandal broad are to be considered privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy the misuse of big data in several cases by media companies and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society barocas and nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected with whom it is shared under what constraints and for what purposes critiques of the v model the v model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information this led to the framework of cognitive big data which characterizes big data applications according to data completeness understanding of the from data data correlation causation and predictability causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability explainability and interpretability humans desire to understand and accept what they understand where algorithms do not cope with this level of automated algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic critiques of novelty large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century including the us census analytics performed by ibm machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent in more recent decades science experiments such as cern have produced data on similar scales to current commercial big data however science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized computing clusters and grids rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave implying a difference in both culture and technology stack critiques of big data execution reips and uwe matzat wrote in that big data had become a fad in scientific research researcher danah boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data this approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another integration across heterogeneous data that might be considered big data and others formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science in the provocative article critical questions for big data the authors title big data a part of mythology large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge with the aura of truth objectivity and accuracy users of big data are often lost in the sheer volume of numbers and working with big data is still subjective and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth recent developments in bi domain such as reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data through automated filtering of data and correlations big structures are full of spurious correlations either because of coincidences law of truly large numbers solely nature of big randomness ramsey theory or existence of factors so the hope of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers speak for themselves and revolutionize scientific method is questioned catherine tucker has pointed to hype around big data writing by itself big data is unlikely to be valuable the article explains the many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets in many big data projects there is no large data analysis happening but the challenge is the extract transform load part of data big data is a buzzword and a vague term but at the same time an obsession with entrepreneurs consultants scientists and the media big data showcases such as google flu trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two similarly academy awards and election predictions solely based on twitter were more often off than on target big data often poses the same challenges as small data adding more data does not solve problems of bias but may emphasize other problems in particular data sources such as twitter are not representative of the overall population and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions google is based on big data statistical analysis of a good job at translating web pages however results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed on the other hand big data may also introduce new problems such as the multiple comparisons problem simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant ioannidis argued that most published research findings are false due to essentially the same effect when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments process a big amount of scientific data although not with big data technology the likelihood of a significant result being false grows fast even more so when only positive results are published furthermore big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated in an example big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the presidential election with varying degrees of success critiques of big data policing and surveillance big data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations due to the less visible nature of surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing objections to big data policing are less likely to arise according to sarah brayne big data surveillance the case of policing big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways placing people under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace thus creating

big data at wikimedia commons the dictionary definition of big data at wiktionary statistics from german statistik orig description of a state a country is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data in applying statistics to a scientific industrial or social problem it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as all people living in a country or every atom composing a crystal statistics deals with every aspect of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments when census data can not be collected statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation two main statistical methods are used in data analysis descriptive statistics which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation and inferential statistics which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation observational errors sampling variation descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution sample or population central tendency or location seeks to characterize the distribution central or typical value while dispersion or variability characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory which deals with the analysis of random phenomena a standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model a hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false given the data that are used in the test working from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognized type i errors null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true giving a false positive and type ii errors null hypothesis fails to be rejected when an it is in fact false giving a false negative multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also occur the presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems introduction statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection analysis interpretation or explanation and presentation of data or as a branch of mathematics some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics while many scientific investigations make use of data statistics is generally concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and in the face of uncertainty in applying statistics to a problem it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied populations can be diverse topics such as all people living in a country or every atom composing a crystal ideally statisticians compile data about the entire population an operation called a census this may be organized by governmental statistical institutes descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data like income while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data like education when a census is not feasible a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied once a sample that is representative of the population is determined data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting again descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data however drawing the sample contains an element of randomness hence the numerical descriptors from the sample are also prone to uncertainty to draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population inferential statistics are needed it uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented while accounting for randomness these inferences may take the form of answering questions about the data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics of the data estimation describing associations within the data correlation and modeling relationships within the data for example using regression analysis inference can extend to the forecasting prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data as well as data mining mathematical statistics mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis linear algebra stochastic analysis differential equations and probability theory history formal discussions on inference date back to arab mathematicians and cryptographers during the islamic golden age between the and centuries wrote the book of cryptographic messages which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations to list all possible arabic words with and without vowels manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding ibn adlan later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis although the term was introduced by the italian scholar girolamo ghilini in with reference to a collection of facts and information about a state it was the german gottfried achenwall in who started using the term as a collection of quantitative information in the modern use for this science the earliest writing containing statistics in europe dates back to with the publication of natural and political observations upon the bills of mortality by john graunt early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data hence its etymology the scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early century to include the collection and analysis of data in general today statistics is widely employed in government business and natural and social sciences the mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as gerolamo cardano blaise pascal pierre de fermat and christiaan huygens although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy such as the work of juan caramuel probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the century particularly in jacob bernoulli posthumous work ars conjectandi this was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable which concerned opinion evidence and argument were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis the method of least squares was first described by legendre in though carl friedrich gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in the modern field of statistics emerged in the late and early century in three stages the first wave at the turn of the century was led by the work of francis galton and karl pearson who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis not just in science but in industry and politics as well galton contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation correlation regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human weight and eyelash length among others pearson developed the pearson correlation coefficient defined as a the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the pearson distribution among many other things galton and pearson founded biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics then called biometry and the latter founded the world first university statistics department at university college london the second wave of the and was initiated by william sealy gosset and reached its culmination in the insights of ronald fisher who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world fisher most important publications were his seminal paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance which was the first to use the statistical term variance his classic work statistical methods for research workers and his the design of experiments where he developed rigorous design of experiments models he originated the concepts of sufficiency ancillary statistics fisher linear discriminator and fisher information he also coined the term null hypothesis during the lady tasting tea experiment which is never proved or established but is possibly disproved in the course of experimentation in his book the genetical theory of natural selection he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as fisher principle which edwards called probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology and fisherian runaway a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway effect found in evolution the final wave which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments emerged from the collaborative work between egon pearson and jerzy neyman in the they introduced the concepts of type ii error power of a test and confidence intervals jerzy neyman in showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive quota sampling today statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology the use of modern computers has expedited statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data statistical data data collection sampling when full census data can not be collected statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models to use a sample as a guide to an entire population it is important that it truly represents the overall population representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole a major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures there are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and more generally the properties of statistical procedures the use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method the difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is roughly that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples statistical inference however moves in the opposite inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population experimental and observational studies a common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables there are two major types of causal statistical studies experimental studies and observational studies in both types of studies the effect of differences of an independent variable or variables on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed the difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted each can be very effective an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated while the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies they are also applied to other kinds of natural experiments and observational which a statistician would use a modified more structured estimation method difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables among many others that produce consistent estimators experiments the basic steps of a statistical experiment are planning the research including finding the number of replicates of the study using the following information preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects alternative hypotheses and the estimated experimental variability consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary statisticians recommend that experiments compare at least one new treatment with a standard treatment or control to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects design of experiments using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error at this stage the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol further examining the data set in secondary analyses to suggest new hypotheses for future study documenting and presenting the results of the study experiments on human behavior have special concerns the famous hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the hawthorne plant of the western electric company the researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers the researchers first measured the productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity it turned out that productivity indeed improved under the experimental conditions however the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness the hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome in this case worker productivity changed due to observation itself those in the hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed observational study an example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer this type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis in this case the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and perhaps through a cohort study and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group a study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest lung cancer are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected types of data various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement the psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any injective transformation ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any transformation interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in celsius or fahrenheit and permit any linear transformation ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined and permit any rescaling transformation because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements can not be reasonably measured numerically sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables which can be either discrete or continuous due to their numerical nature such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the boolean data type polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type and continuous variables with the real data type involving arithmetic but the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented other categorizations have been proposed for example mosteller and tukey distinguished grades ranks counted fractions counts amounts and balances nelder described continuous counts continuous ratios count ratios and categorical modes of data see also chrisman van den berg the issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions the relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer methods descriptive statistics a descriptive statistic in the count noun sense is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics or inductive statistics in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent inferential statistics statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates it is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population terminology and theory of inferential statistics statistics estimators and pivotal quantities consider independent identically distributed iid random variables with a given probability distribution standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these iid variables the population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters a statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample but not a function of unknown parameters the probability distribution of the statistic though may have unknown parameters consider now a function of the unknown parameter an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance and sample covariance a random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot widely used pivots include the the chi square statistic and student between two estimators of a given parameter the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient furthermore an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter other desirable properties for estimators include umvue estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter this still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation several methods have been proposed the method of moments the maximum likelihood method the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually but not necessarily that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time the best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial the null hypothesis asserts that the defendant is innocent whereas the alternative hypothesis asserts that the defendant is guilty the indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt the status quo stands in opposition to and is maintained unless is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt however failure to reject in this case does not imply innocence but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict so the jury does not necessarily accept but fails to reject while one can not prove a null hypothesis one can test how close it is to being true with a power test which tests for type ii errors what statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis error working from a null hypothesis two broad categories of error are recognized type i errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a false positive type ii errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a false negative standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value such as the sample or population mean while standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean a statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value a residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample also called prediction mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators a widely used class of estimators root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares and these are called methods of least squares in contrast to least absolute deviations the latter gives equal weight to small and big errors while the former gives more weight to large errors residual sum of squares is also differentiable which provides a handy property for doing regression least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called least squares also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term disturbance or more simply noise both linear regression and regression are addressed in polynomial least squares which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable y axis as a function of the independent variable x axis and the deviations errors noise disturbances from the estimated fitted curve measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also be important the presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems interval estimation most studies only sample part of a population so results do not fully represent the whole population any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population often they are expressed as confidence intervals formally a confidence interval for a value is a range where if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions yielding a different dataset the interval would include the true population value in of all possible cases this does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is from the frequentist perspective such a claim does not even make sense as the true value is not a random variable either the true value is or is not within the given interval however it is true that before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval the probability is that the interval will cover the true value at this point the limits of the interval are random variables one approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from bayesian statistics this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by probability that is as a bayesian probability in principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical an interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter interval or right sided interval but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds significance statistics rarely give a simple type answer to the question under analysis interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis sometimes referred to as the the standard approach is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis a critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis the probability of type i error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true statistical significance and the probability of type ii error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true the statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms for example in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate the significance level is the largest that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis this test is logically equivalent to saying that the is the probability assuming the null hypothesis is true of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic therefore the smaller the significance level the lower the probability of committing type i error some problems are usually associated with this framework see criticism of hypothesis testing a difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this one response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted the however does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies a better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it fallacy of the transposed conditional aka prosecutor fallacy criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis the null hypothesis to be favored since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result an alternative to this approach is offered by bayesian inference although it requires establishing a prior probability rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis as everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size and therefore under fat tails may be seriously examples some statistical tests and procedures are exploratory data analysis exploratory data analysis eda is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics often with visual methods a statistical model can be used or not but primarily eda is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task misuse misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors for instance social policy medical practice and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics even when statistical techniques are correctly applied the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise the statistical significance of a trend in the measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance the set of basic statistical skills and skepticism that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy there is a general perception that statistical knowledge is intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter a mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional and the book how to lie with statistics by darrell huff outlines a range of considerations in an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted warne lazo ramos and ritter ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs most people do not look for bias or errors so they are not noticed thus people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented to make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate the sample taken must be representative of the whole according to huff the dependability of a sample can be destroyed by bias allow yourself some degree of skepticism to assist in the understanding of statistics huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case who says so does have an axe to grind how does know does have the resources to know the facts what missing does give us a complete picture did someone change the subject does offer us the right answer to the wrong problem does it make sense is conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know misinterpretation correlation the concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables properties of the population under consideration tend to vary together as if they were connected for example a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people the two variables are said to be correlated however they may or may not be the cause of one another the correlation phenomena could be caused by a third previously unconsidered phenomenon called a lurking variable or confounding variable for this reason there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables applications applied statistics theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics applied statistics sometimes referred to as statistical science comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference as well as encompassing mathematical statistics mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that do not have expertise relevant to their particular questions machine learning and data mining machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms

regression and correlation modern fundamental statistical courses for undergraduate students focus on correct test selection results interpretation and use of free statistics software statistical computing the rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models but powerful computers coupled with suitable numerical algorithms caused an increased interest in nonlinear models such as neural networks as well as the creation of new types such as generalized linear models and multilevel models increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling such as permutation tests and the bootstrap while techniques such as gibbs sampling have made use of bayesian models more feasible the computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on experimental and empirical statistics a large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as mathematica sas spss and business statistics in business statistics is a widely used and decision support tool it is particularly applied in financial management marketing management and production services and operations management statistics is also heavily used in management accounting and auditing the discipline of management science formalizes the use of statistics and other mathematics in business econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships a typical business statistics course is intended for business majors and covers descriptive statistics collection description analysis and summary of data probability typically the binomial and normal distributions test of hypotheses and confidence intervals linear regression and correlation courses may include forecasting time series decision trees multiple linear regression and other topics from business analytics more generally see also business mathematics university level professional certification programs such as the cfa often include topics in statistics statistics applied to mathematics or the arts traditionally statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a methodology that was required learning in most sciences this tradition has changed with the use of statistics in contexts what was once considered a dry subject taken in many fields as a is now viewed enthusiastically initially derided by some mathematical purists it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas in number theory scatter plots of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns which may then lead to hypotheses predictive methods of statistics in forecasting combining chaos theory and fractal geometry can be used to create video works the process art of jackson pollock relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed with the advent of computers statistical methods were applied to formalize such natural processes to make and analyze moving video art methods of statistics may be used predicatively in performance art as in a card trick based on a markov process that only works some of the time the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology statistics can be used to predicatively create art as in the statistical or stochastic music invented by iannis xenakis where the music is though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics specialized disciplines statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types

published till only four years before her death i do not know whether in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth and the critical revision of middle life there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction which as it seems to me it possesses over all the others the plot though not elaborate is almost regular enough for fielding hardly a character hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story the elopement of lydia and wickham is not like that of crawford and rushworth coup de connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier and brings about the denouement with complete propriety all the minor passages the loves of jane and bingley the advent of collins the visit to hunsford the derbyshire tour fit in after the same unostentatious but masterly fashion there is no attempt at the business which in the transactions between frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue emma contributes it in a fashion which i do not think the best feature of that otherwise admirable book although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of conduct given by wickham and by the awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from the gradual transformation of own feelings from positive aversion to actual love i do not know whether the hand of the playwright has ever been laid pride and prejudice i dare say that if it were the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights the too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery but if the attempt were made it would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction which sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself appear at once on the think however though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics that construction is not the highest merit the choicest gift of the novelist it sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye and the want of it will sometimes mar those graces appreciably though not quite consciously to eyes by no means but a very novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character or which displayed consummate command of dialogue perhaps the rarest of all faculties would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths and despite the ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story i for one should pride and prejudice lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of miss humour and of her faculty of masterpieces who may indeed admit john thorpe the eltons norris and one or two others to their company but who in one instance certainly and perhaps in others are still superior to characteristics of miss humour are so subtle and delicate that they are perhaps at all times easier to apprehend than to express and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity on the whole to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus the differences of scheme of time of subject of literary convention are of course obvious enough the difference of sex does not perhaps count for much for there was a distinctly feminine element in spectator and in jane genius there was though nothing mannish much that was masculine but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality demureness extreme minuteness of touch avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty it is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the savagery of swift the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness of fielding and smollett even with the ferocious practical jokes that her immediate predecessor miss burney allowed without very much protest yet both in addison and in miss austen there is though a restrained and an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool a man in the early eighteenth century of course could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth and no doubt miss principles as well as her heart would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in spectator describes with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world how his wife and his friend induce him to play at but spectator that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry shapely and assures her selected mentor that admires spectators might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of while on the other hand some i think unreasonably have found in touches of miss own such as her satire of regrets over her son but this word is one of the most misused in the english language especially when by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense it is applied not to rough and snarling invective but to gentle and oblique satire if cynicism means the perception of other side the sense of accepted hells beneath the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed and that to seem is not identical with to be if this be cynicism then every man and woman who is not a fool who does not care to live in a paradise who has knowledge of nature and the world and life is a cynic and in that sense miss austen certainly was one she may even have been one in the further sense that like her own bennet she took an epicurean delight in dissecting in displaying in setting at work her fools and her mean persons i think she did take this delight and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman while she was immensely the better for it as an respect of her art generally goldwin smith has truly observed that has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it combined with the narrowness of her field and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other than of cosway or any of his kind and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word in connection with her if her world is a microcosm the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing one of about three years and another of not much more than five she executed six capital works and has not left a single failure it is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decade that of the seventies independently exhibited the full romantic quality even scott required hill and mountain and ballad even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell miss austen was an english girl brought up in a country retirement at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears when their studies their ways their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment miss austen too drew back when the white frost touched her shoes but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black if her knowledge was not very extended she knew two things which only genius knows the one was humanity and the other was art on the first head she could not make a mistake her men though limited are true and her women are in the old sense as to art if she has never tried idealism her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely take almost any frenchman except the late de maupassant and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression you get none you are lucky if discarding of what he gives you can shape a real impression out of the rest but with miss austen the myriad trivial unforced strokes build up the picture like magic nothing is false nothing is superfluous when to take the present book only collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth bennet was stirring the and we how bennet would have stirred the fire when darcy his himself touch in each case is like that of swift by the breadth of my which impressed the thackeray with just and outspoken admiration indeed fantastic as it may seem i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways as i have put her to addison in swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal the ineffable collins collins is great greater than anything addison ever did almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself it has been said that no one ever was like him but in the first place he like him he is there alive imperishable more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops of and distinguished in the second place it is rash i think to conclude that an actual collins was impossible or at the end of the eighteenth century it is very interesting that we possess in this same gallery what may be called a spoiled first draught or an unsuccessful study of him in john dashwood the formality the the meanness are there but the portrait is only half alive and is felt to be even a little unnatural collins is perfectly natural and perfectly alive in fact for all the there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side and more than one of humanity and especially humanity its philistinism its but morality its formal pettiness its grovelling respect for rank its materialism its selfishness receives exhibition i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically the greatness of collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh the latter like collins himself has been charged with exaggeration there is perhaps a very faint shade of colour for the charge but it seems to me very faint indeed even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as as neglectful of good manners as lady catherine a hundred years ago an daughter the lady powerful if not exactly bountiful of an country parish rich long out of marital authority and so forth had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now as for bennet miss austen and darcy and even miss elizabeth herself were i am inclined to think rather hard on him for the of his conduct his wife was evidently and must always have been a quite irreclaimable fool and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic from no other point of view is he open to any reproach except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kind in the kind that we laugh with not at that even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife or when putting collins through his paces but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves i be the survivor and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study these are the things which give miss readers the pleasant shocks the delightful thrills which are felt by the readers of swift of fielding and we may here add of thackeray as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these goodness of the minor characters pride and prejudice been already alluded to and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space and impossible in this bennet we have glanced at and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true much the same may be said of kitty and lydia but it is not every author even of genius who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages with mary miss austen has taken rather less pains though she has been even more unkind to her not merely in the text but as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which austen leigh has given us in dooming her privately to marry of the habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments of playing and singing too long in public are no doubt grievous and criminal but perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that generation it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection affection and respect of a peculiar kind doubtless with which one regards collins when she draws the moral of fall i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor anguish over the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases miss darcy and miss de bourgh jane wickham and the rest must pass without special comment further than the remark that charlotte lucas her egregious papa though delightful is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind and that wickham though something of miss hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another only genius could have made charlotte what she is yet not disagreeable wickham what he is without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss heroes the only possible competitor being henry tilney whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison it has sometimes i believe been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable here again i can not go with the objectors own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered is perfectly rational and sufficient and nothing could be psychologically speaking causa verior its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of scornful refusal acting on a ex hypothesi nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb he might have been still smarting under his rejection or suspicious that the girl had come his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense but not really injured in disposition and thoroughly in love as for his being in love elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal secret of that charm many men and not a few women from miss austen herself downwards have felt and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained elizabeth of course belongs to allegro allegra of the army of venus miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties and except the fine eyes and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion and was not very tall we hear nothing about her looks but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever almost in the better sense of that objectionable word and secondly in her being entirely destitute of for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked but she never and she never attacks first some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness but that is nothing and when she comes to serious business as in the great proposal scene with darcy which is as it should be the climax of the interest of the book and in the final battle with lady catherine she is unexceptionable then too she is a perfectly natural girl she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents first personality with as personal a feeling by the way the reproach that the of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust for things of the same kind expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely might have been heard in more than one during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy and she lets the injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the all this does not explain her charm which taking beauty as a common form of all heroines may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness her wit her affectionate and natural disposition of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals even naughty ones from the fascinating wickham elizabeth with nothing offensive viraginous of the about her has by nature what the best modern not women have by education and experience a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose and that most will away with her if they can though not in the least and mannish grown she has no mere sensibility no nasty niceness about her the form of passion common and likely to seem natural in miss day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other or both of these qualities that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate but i at least have not the slightest doubt that she would have married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it and anybody who can read between lines will not find the conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the della cruscans of their own day and perhaps do look to the della cruscans of after all what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm it is there there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not in the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love there are at least five with whom as it seems to me no man of taste and spirit can help doing so their names are in chronological order elizabeth bennet diana vernon argemone lavington beatrix esmond and barbara grant i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone i should i think for mere occasional companionship have preferred diana and barbara but to live with and to marry i do not know that any one of

want of a wife however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters dear bennet said his lady to him one day you heard that netherfield park is let at last bennet replied that he had not it is returned she long has just been here and she told me all about bennet made no answer not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing this was invitation enough my dear you must know long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next is his name he married or single single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls so how can it affect them dear bennet replied his wife can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of that his design in settling here nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them bingley might like you the best of the dear you flatter me i certainly had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think my dear you must indeed go and see bingley when he comes into the is more than i engage for i assure consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for to visit him if you do are over scrupulous surely i dare say bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so as lydia but you are always giving the have none of them much to recommend them replied he are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at you do not know what i i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character mind was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news chapter ii bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with hope bingley will like it are not in a way to know bingley likes said her mother resentfully we are not to you forget mamma said elizabeth we shall meet him at the assemblies and that long has promised to introduce do not believe long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of more have i said bennet i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters keep coughing so kitty for sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to has no discretion in her coughs said her father times them do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully is your next ball to be lizzy so it is cried her mother long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce bingley to bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing honour your circumspection a acquaintance is certainly very little one can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if do not venture somebody else will and after all long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on the girls stared at their father bennet said only nonsense can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i can not quite agree with you what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how mary is adjusting her ideas he continued us return to am sick of bingley cried his wife am sorry to hear but why did you not tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we can not escape the acquaintance the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while good it was in you my dear bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till kitty you may cough as much as you choose said bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you the youngest i dare say bingley will dance with you at the next said lydia stoutly am not afraid for though i the youngest the the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner chapter iii not all that bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of bingley they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of heart were entertained i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said bennet to her husband all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish in a few days bingley returned visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched and already had bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the it consisted of only five altogether bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man bingley was and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend darcy danced only once with hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it darcy said he must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with bingley followed his advice darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear my dear bennet as she entered the room have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the he had had any compassion for cried her husband impatiently would not have danced half so much for sake say no more of his partners o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance my dear continued bennet am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon gown here she was interrupted again bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of darcy i can assure you she added lizzy does not lose much by not suiting fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your i quite detest the chapter iv when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him is just what a ought to be said she lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding is also handsome replied elizabeth a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a not you did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take by surprise and never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider lizzy you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i know you do and it is which makes the wonder with good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this sisters too do you their manners are not equal to not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their fortune and their own had been acquired by trade bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose chapter within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at had made him courteous lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about was intimate friend that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate began the evening well charlotte said bennet with civil to miss lucas were first but he seemed to like his second you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about you mean what i overheard between him and robinson did not i mention it to you asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there can not be two opinions on that my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you overhearings were more to the purpose than eliza said charlotte darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just beg you will not put it into head to be vexed by his for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his you quite sure is not there a little mistake said jane certainly saw darcy speaking to because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke bingley told me said jane he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with he is remarkably do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that long does not keep a carriage and had to come to the ball in a hack do not mind his not talking to long said miss lucas i wish he had danced with time lizzy said her mother would not dance with if i were believe i may safely promise you to dance with pride said miss lucas not offend so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one can not wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a to be is very true replied elizabeth i could easily forgive pride if he had not mortified observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of i were as rich as darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every you would drink a great deal more than you ought said bennet if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit chapter vi the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was returned in due form miss pleasing manners grew on the of hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he admire her and to it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it eliza that he does not know disposition as you if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavor to conceal it he must find it he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she plan is a good one replied elizabeth nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not feelings she is not acting by design as yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his as you represent it had she merely with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been said charlotte wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way occupied in observing attention to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william where a large party were assembled does darcy mean said she to charlotte listening to my conversation with colonel forster is a question which darcy only can if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said not you think darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady are severe on will be turn soon to be teased said miss lucas am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best on miss persevering however she added well if it must be so it and gravely glancing at darcy is a very fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began a charming amusement for young people this is darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can sir william only smiled friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself saw me dance at meryton i believe indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid have a house in town i conclude darcy bowed had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her dear miss eliza why are not you dancing darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you can not refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before and taking her hand he would have given it to darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we can not wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley can guess the subject of your should imagine are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections darcy replied with great intrepidity elizabeth elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed along chapter vii property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds she had a sister married to a philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the their visits to philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject bennet coolly observed all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london am astonished my dear said bennet you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of children it should not be of my own my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of but as it happens they are all of them very is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly dear bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir in his cried lydia aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud nind dear friend you are not so compassionate as to dine with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever the officers cried lydia wonder my aunt did not tell us of out said bennet is very i have the carriage said jane my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all would be a good scheme said elizabeth you were sure that they would not offer to send her but the gentlemen will have chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to had much rather go in the my dear your father can not spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm bennet are not they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get if you have got them said elizabeth purpose will be she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back was a lucky idea of mine indeed said bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth nind dearest lizzie find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and a headache there is not much the matter with me my dear said bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of bingley and under your i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the elizabeth feeling really anxious determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution can you be so silly cried her mother to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get shall be very fit to see jane which is all i this a hint to me lizzy said her father send for the horses indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together we make haste said lydia as they walked along we may see something of captain carter before he in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was shown into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their manners there was something better than politeness there was and kindness darcy said very little and hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was despatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes chapter viii at five the two ladies retired to dress and at six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of bingley she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty hurst thought the same and added has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowzy and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its picture may be very exact louisa said bingley this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my observed it darcy i am sure said miss bingley i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see make such an walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most indifference to shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley am afraid darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine at all he replied were brightened by the a short pause followed this speech and hurst began again have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton and they have another who lives somewhere near is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily they had uncles enough to fill cheapside cried bingley would not make them one jot less it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear vulgar relations with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself on entering the she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book hurst looked at her with astonishment you prefer reading to cards said he is rather eliza bennet said miss bingley cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth am a great reader and i have pleasure in many nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room am astonished said miss bingley my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley darcy ought to be good he replied has been the work of many then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build house i wish it may be half as delightful as wish it i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell am talking of possibilities my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the and stationed herself between bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley she be as tall as i am think she will she is now about miss elizabeth height or rather i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is is amazing to me said bingley young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know any one who can not do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i can not boast of knowing more than in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really i i am sure said miss bingley observed elizabeth must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished i do comprehend a great deal in certainly cried his faithful assistant one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half this she must possess added darcy to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive am no longer surprised at your knowing six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this never saw such a woman never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i daresay it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed is meanness in the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their proposal and it was settled that jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister chapter ix elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately despatched and its contents as quickly complied with bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected i have sir was her answer is a great deal too ill to be moved jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your cried bingley must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments am sure she added it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to you have a sweet room here bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short i do is done in a hurry replied he therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her yes i understand you wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as cried her mother where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at did not know before continued bingley immediately you were a studier of character it must be an amusing but intricate characters are the amusing they have at least that country said darcy in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for indeed cried bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood assure you there is quite as much of going on in the country as in everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph can not see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it bingley i am in the country he replied never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy to think the country was nothing at mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother quite mistook darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since coming away she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to everybody is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the charlotte dine with you she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the for my part bingley always keep servants that can do their own work daughters are brought up differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that think charlotte so plain but then she is our particular seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother in town so much in love with her that my was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love have been used to consider poetry as the of love said darcy a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence bennet began repeating her thanks to bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield lydia was a stout girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural which the attentions of the officers to whom her good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her ear am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given ball she added shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of in spite of all miss witticisms on chapter x the day passed much as the day before had done hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the the loo table however did not appear darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister hurst and bingley were at piquet and hurst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer write uncommonly are mistaken i write rather many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year letters of business too how odious i should think them is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to tell your sister that i long to see have already told her so once by your am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably you but i always mend my can you contrive to write so even he was silent your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her darcy are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother he does write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy style of writing is very different from cried miss bingley writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my humility bingley said elizabeth disarm is more deceitful said darcy the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect which of the two do you call little recent piece of modesty indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else cried bingley is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the daresay you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a have only proved by this cried elizabeth bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did am exceedingly gratified said bingley your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it my word i can not exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its yield readily easily to the of a friend is no merit with yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of appear to me darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties all means cried bingley us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense see your design bingley said his friend dislike an argument and want to silence i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of you ask said elizabeth no sacrifice on my side and darcy had much better finish his darcy took her advice and did finish his letter when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some that lay on the instrument how frequently eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her you not feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence said she heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you i do not elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day will give your a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it to cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be at that moment they were met from another walk by hurst and elizabeth herself did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard used us abominably ill answered hurst away without telling us that you were coming then taking the disengaged arm of darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening chapter xi when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for salutation he was full of joy and attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight when tea was over hurst reminded his of the but in vain she had obtained private intelligence that darcy did not wish for cards and hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her conversation with miss bennet miss attention was quite as much engaged in watching progress through book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a you mean darcy cried her brother may go to bed if he chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my should like balls infinitely better she replied they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him at all was her answer depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the shocking cried miss bingley never heard anything so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth can all plague and punish one another tease him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be upon my honour i do i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me tease calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject darcy may hug darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a bingley said he given me credit for more than can be the wisest and best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a replied elizabeth are such people but i hope i am not one of i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to as vanity and vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good elizabeth turned away to hide a smile examination of darcy is over i presume said miss bingley pray what is the result am perfectly convinced by it that darcy has no defect he owns it himself without said darcy have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for is a failing indeed cried elizabeth resentment a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really can not at it you are safe from is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can defect is a propensity to hate yours he replied with a smile wilfully to misunderstand let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share you will not mind my waking her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention chapter xii in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to wishes for she was impatient to get home bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married chapter xiii hope my dear said bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning you have ordered a good dinner because i have reason to expect an addition to our family do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a eyes sparkled gentleman and a stranger it is bingley i am sure why jane you never dropped a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this is bingley said her husband is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he my dear cried his wife can not bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about certainly is a most iniquitous affair said bennet nothing can clear collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will right near westerham kent sir disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologize for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november by four and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your and friend four therefore we may expect this gentleman said bennet as he folded up the letter seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage it is difficult said jane guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required must be an oddity i think said she can not make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we can not suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see point of composition said mary letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother letter had done away much of her and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall young man of his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so allude perhaps to the entail of this sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of admiration the hall the and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing but here he was set right by bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour chapter xiv during dinner bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable bennet could not have chosen better collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets upstairs is all very proper and civil i am sure said bennet i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her think you said she was a widow sir has she any family has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive cried bennet shaking her head she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to judge very properly said bennet it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by however the dose had been enough and bennet was glad to take his guest into the again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with you know mamma that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to hear more about it and to ask when denny comes back from lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but collins much offended laid aside his book and said have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young then turning to bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with bennet and prepared for backgammon chapter xv collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness and humility having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part his plan did not vary on seeing them miss lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an with bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on to her daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not of any prepossession her daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and collins was to attend them at the request of bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such doings discomposed bennet exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting collins to join his daughters in their walk and collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best parts of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend denny and wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of house and then made their bows in spite of miss pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards collins by introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become disagreeable some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister collins on his return highly gratified bennet by admiring manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life chapter xvi as no objection was made to the young engagement with their aunt and all scruples of leaving and bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the that wickham had accepted their invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady and found that the alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as were superior to the stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such rivals for the notice of the fair as wickham and the officers collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist know little of the game at present said he i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long darcy had been staying there a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added is a man of very large property in derbyshire i replied wickham estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my elizabeth could not but look surprised may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with darcy much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very have no right to give opinion said wickham to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own my word i say no more than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by can not pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be should take him even on slight acquaintance to be an wickham only shook his head wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking he is likely to be in this country much do not at all know but i nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the no it is not for to be driven away by darcy if wishes to avoid seeing he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry was the prospect of constant society and good society he added was my chief inducement to enter the shire i know it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just the late darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i can not do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given heavens cried elizabeth how could be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion him and him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly time or other he be but it shall not be by till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them what said she after a pause have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given had not thought darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few reflection however she continued remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham can hardly be just to elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added young man too like whose very countenance may vouch for your being but she contented herself with one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care father began life in the profession which your uncle philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of use to the late darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by darcy a most intimate confidential friend darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my active superintendence and when immediately before my death darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to as of affection to strange cried elizabeth abominable i wonder that the very pride of this darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call wonderful replied wickham almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than such abominable pride as his have ever done him good it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also pride which with brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying am astonished at his intimacy with bingley how can bingley who seems itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know bingley at is a amiable charming man he can not know what darcy not but darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy know very well madam said he when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little attention was caught and after observing collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh catherine de bourgh she replied very lately given him a living i hardly know how collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady connections i never heard of her existence till the day before daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already to another collins said she highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and collins in describing the civility of and philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house chapter xvii elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that darcy could be so unworthy of regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained have both said she deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear too or we shall be obliged to think ill of as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places darcy to be treating his favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh can much more easily believe being imposed on than that wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to beg your pardon one knows exactly what to but jane could think with certainty on only one point that bingley if he imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it i can have my mornings to myself said she is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance am by no means of opinion i assure you said he a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help for it however happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer and proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia chapter xviii till elizabeth entered the at netherfield and looked in vain for wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for pleasure in the invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to bingley whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification collins awkward and solemn apologizing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her dare say you will find him very forbid would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to darcy and reading in her looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with is turn to say something now darcy talked about the dance and ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said well that reply will do for the present perhaps i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but we may be you talk by rule then while you are dancing one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine replied elizabeth archly i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the of a is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he near it may be to i can not pretend to say think it a faithful portrait must not decide on my own he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new the effect was immediate a deeper shade of overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his friends whether he may be equally capable of them is less has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said interruption has made me forget what we were talking do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i can not think you of books said he smiling oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different i can not talk of books in a my head is always full of something always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming remember hearing you once say darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its am said he with a firm voice never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice hope is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at i ask to what these questions tend to the illustration of character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity am trying to make it what is your success she shook her head do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me can readily believe answered he gravely reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that darcy is not in the least to blame that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of steward and of i can assure you he informed me beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer my interference it was kindly girl said elizabeth to herself are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of being in the fairest way for happiness want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her you have learnt about wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my replied jane have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that wickham has deserved much less attention from darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose bingley does not know wickham he never saw him till the other morning at account then is what he has received from darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him have not a doubt of sincerity said elizabeth warmly you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery have found out said he a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my are not going to introduce yourself to darcy i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words and catherine de it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last collins allowed him to speak replied with an air of distant civility collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way collins then returned to elizabeth have no reason i assure you said he be dissatisfied with my reception darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like two sisters her thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to bingley it was an animating subject and bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical is darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing may not like to sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to i said collins so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i can not acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the and with a bow to darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than bennet himself while his wife seriously commended collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and engaged conversation to herself she was at least free from the offence of further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to wickham and rejoiced in it the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a of bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of collins who was complimenting bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn when at length they arose to take leave bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for the worth of each was eclipsed by bingley and netherfield chapter xix the next day opened a new scene at longbourn collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise bennet instantly answered dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out do not go i beg you will not go collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i am going away no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you and upon seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added i upon your staying and hearing elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone collins began me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly the idea of collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while jenkinson was arranging miss de footstool that she said collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for sake and for your let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per which will not be yours till after your decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now are too hasty sir she cried forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline am not now to learn replied collins with a formal wave of the hand it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere my word sir cried elizabeth hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the it certain that lady catherine would think so said collins very gravely i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any this matter may be considered therefore as finally and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not collins thus addressed her i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female collins cried elizabeth with some warmth puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being to such perseverance in wilful elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female chapter xx collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so depend upon it collins she added lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will her know me for interrupting you madam cried collins if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my you quite misunderstand me said bennet alarmed is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as a girl as ever lived i will go directly to bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech what are you talking collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have collins and collins begins to say that he will not have what am i to do on the occasion it seems a hopeless to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying her be called down she shall hear my bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library here child cried her father as she appeared have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was well and this offer of marriage you have refused have well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so bennet or i will never see her unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do marry collins and i will never see you again if you elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed do you mean bennet by talking in this way you promised me to upon her marrying dear replied her husband have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the where bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth there she comes continued bennet as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let collins and me have a little conversation elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice bennet thus began the projected conversation collins dear madam replied he us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your favour without having paid yourself and bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to chapter xxi the discussion of offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother as for the gentleman himself feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of ill humour or ill health collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence been found said he the time drew near that i had better not meet darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little paper well covered with a fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where hurst had a house the next was in these words do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for to these expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his is unlucky said she after a short pause you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters bingley will not be detained in london by decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it can not be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive is evident by this added jane he comes back no more this is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know i read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what think you of sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject there can for mine is totally different will you hear it shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about jane shook her head jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure can not she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere must decide for yourself said elizabeth if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse can you talk so said jane faintly smiling must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not did not think you would and that being the case i can not consider your situation with much if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter xxii the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her keeps him in good humour said she i am more obliged to you than i can charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of was performed when the ladies moved for the night and bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them dear madam he replied invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as they were all astonished and bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said is there not danger of lady disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your dear sir replied collins am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her can not be too much on your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that shall take no me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out to collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that collins should be able to procure any good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness see what you are feeling replied charlotte must be surprised very much surprised so lately as collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage elizabeth quietly answered and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen chapter xxiii elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though sour looks and remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a abode in the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very it needed all steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as bennet was dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband bennet said she is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that should be forced to make way for and live to see her take my place in it dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that may be the this was not very consoling to bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before can not bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind should not you mind should not mind anything at us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such never can be thankful bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from own daughters i can not understand and all for the sake of collins too why should have it more than anybody else leave it to yourself to determine said bennet chapter xxiv miss letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her being an inmate of house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to assertion of her being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she could think of nothing else and yet whether regard had really died away or were suppressed by his interference whether he had been aware of attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it can not last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing doubt me cried jane slightly colouring you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but dear jane exclaimed elizabeth are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her warm affection said elizabeth is not fair wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody only want to think perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider respectability and prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane collins is a conceited pompous silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned instances i can not misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it men take care that they it is designedly done they can not be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons am far from attributing any part of conduct to design said elizabeth without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other feelings and want of resolution will do the do you impute it to either of those to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him in conjunction with his can not believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time name was scarcely ever mentioned between them bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day best comfort was that bingley must be down again in the summer bennet treated the matter differently lizzy said he one day sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect good said bennet it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else darcy was condemned as the worst of men chapter xxv after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so and agreeable gardiner who was several years younger than bennet and philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it do not blame jane she continued jane would have got bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth it will not do for we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days that expression of in is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how love never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her ready acquiescence hope added gardiner no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it darcy may perhaps have of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it bingley never stirs without much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister will not be able to help will drop the acquaintance but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of attractions miss bennet accepted her invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions gardiner rendered suspicious by warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present treatment of him she tried to remember something of that reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud boy chapter xxvi caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your dear aunt this is being serious and i hope to engage you to be serious then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent you are not serious beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh abominable darcy my opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wiser to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not your mother of inviting i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile true it will be wise in me to refrain from but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an tone that she they might be thursday was to be the and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said shall depend on hearing from you very often you certainly i have another favour to ask will you come and see me shall often meet i hope in am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost aunt she continued going into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley did not think caroline in spirits were her words she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to bingley her being in town four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss inattention after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i can not help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i can not but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i can not understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry sister as by account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less perhaps in this case than in did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards they are even impartial towards miss king i can not find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i can not say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the chapter xxvii with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of collins there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became as perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing her the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a girl but as as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir too long he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information it was a journey of only miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to door jane was at a window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their appearance would not allow them to wait in the and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance gardiner then rallied her niece on desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well my dear elizabeth she added sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of he paid her not the smallest attention till her death made her mistress of this fortune why should he if it were not allowable for him to gain affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if does not object to it why should not objecting does not justify it only shows her being deficient in something herself sense or cried elizabeth it as you choose shall be mercenary and shall be lizzy that is what i do choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after care lizzy that speech savours strongly of before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said gardiner perhaps to the no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful dear dear aunt she rapturously cried delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we know where we have gone we recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of chapter xxviii every object in the next journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when collins joining in observed miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her carriage is regularly ordered for us i say one of her carriages for she has catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte a most attentive true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the who breathless with agitation cried out my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate is this all cried elizabeth expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake is not lady catherine the old lady is jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day chapter xxix triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady condescension as he knew not how to admire enough confess said he i should not have been at all surprised by her asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh when they ascended the steps to the hall alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation from the entrance hall of which collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her and brought wickham immediately to mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted she inquired into domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed estate is entailed on collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de family do you play and sing miss bennet then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing of them did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw not at none of you is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of mother would have no objection but my father hates your governess left you never had any governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her collins did i tell you of lady calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure catherine said she have given me a are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young my youngest is not sixteen perhaps is full young to be much in company but really i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of my word said her ladyship give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling ladyship can hardly expect me to own lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence can not be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your am not when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed lady catherine sir william and and collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologizing if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on side and as many bows on sir they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy collins and he was very soon obliged to take her praise into his own hands chapter xxx sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out very few days passed in which collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that joints of meat were too large for her family elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady curiosity in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen them from her room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding may thank you eliza for this piece of civility darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely courtesied to him without saying a word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a pause added eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the subject was pursued no further and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away chapter xxxi colonel manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till almost a week after the arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but darcy they had only seen at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of darcy eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it were talking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his proficiency am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine pray tell her from me that she can not expect to excel if she does not practise a great assure you madam he replied she does not need such advice she practises very much the better it can not be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in room she would be in way you know in that part of the darcy looked a little ashamed of his and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said mean to frighten me darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate shall not say that you are mistaken he replied you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to am not afraid of you said he smilingly let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam should like to know how he behaves among shall hear then but prepare for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner darcy you can not deny the had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own and nobody can ever be introduced in a well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your said darcy should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am to recommend myself to we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is to recommend himself to strangers can answer your question said fitzwilliam applying to him it is because he will not give himself the certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy conversing easily with those i have never seen before i can not catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see fingers said elizabeth not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe fingers as capable as any other of superior darcy smiled and said are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry had she been his relation lady catherine continued her remarks on performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her carriage was ready to take them all home chapter xxxii elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise darcy and darcy only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologized for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergency recollecting she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london so i thank she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added think i have understood that bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same should not be surprised said darcy he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him he took the hint and soon began with seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when collins first came to believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a journey yes i call it a very easy should never have considered the distance as one of the of the match cried elizabeth should never have said collins was settled her is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case and collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself her family under less than the present darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said can not have a right to such very strong local attachment can not have been always at elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk the surprised them darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen can not be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel manners she believed he might have the best informed mind but why darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated collins knew not what to make of him colonel occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter xxxiii more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even the third it seemed like wilful or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of and happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage she was engaged one day as she walked in last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said did not know before that you ever walked this have been making the tour of the park he replied i generally do every year and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther i should have turned in a and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together you certainly leave kent on saturday said she if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to and my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for are home questions and perhaps i can not say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons can not marry where they where they like women of fortune which i think they very often habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to this thought elizabeth for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone pray what is the usual price of an younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with said colonel fitzwilliam is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss you indeed and pray what sort of a guardian do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man he is a great friend of yes said elizabeth drily darcy is uncommonly kind to bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of of him yes i really believe darcy take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all is it you mean is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the family it would be an unpleasant may depend upon my not mentioning remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last darcy give you his reasons for this interference understood that there were some very strong objections against the what arts did he use to separate them did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling only told me what i have now told elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful am thinking of what you have been telling me said she conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge are rather disposed to call his interference officious do not see what right darcy had to decide on the propriety of his inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam it is lessening the honour of my triumph very this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world men over whom darcy could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london jane herself she exclaimed could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections had material weight with darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining bingley for his sister the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady being rather displeased by her staying at home chapter xxxiv when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw darcy walk into the room in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could gratitude i would now thank you but i can not i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this darcy who was leaning against the with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to feelings dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small might as well inquire replied she with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted you dare not you can not deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards i have been kinder than towards elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her it is not merely this affair she continued which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others take an eager interest in that concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously his misfortunes have been great of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said are mistaken darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter observation and hurried her away to her room chapter xxxv elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at eight in the morning and was as follows not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both can not be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william accidental information that attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if have not been mistaken here must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i can not blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a education my father was not only fond of this young society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to wickham who left the place immediately and younge was of course removed from her charge chief object was unquestionably my fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of should make assertions valueless you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you chapter xxxvi elizabeth when darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence but when this subject was succeeded by his account of wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming must be false this can not be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing darcy that darcy might leave the country but that should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in further justification of darcy she could not but allow that bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as bingley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd despicably have i acted she cried who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that explanation had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her attachment and she could not help remembering what opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in tones of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus by the rest of her family and as she considered that disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter chapter xxxvii the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her indignation would have been would she have said how would she have behaved were the questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the party assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer collins will be very glad of your company i am am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon bennet could certainly spare you for another my father can not he wrote last week to hurry my your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original lady catherine seemed resigned collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two go with her miss darcy the daughter of darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to to let them go uncle is to send a servant for your uncle he keeps a does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine irritable and completely under guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever anxiety on behalf was another prevailing concern and explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the development of character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both chapter xxxviii on saturday morning elizabeth and collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary know not miss elizabeth said he collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attention she had received must make feel the obliged collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady great attentions to collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to and gardiner though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings he added will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off gracious cried maria after a few silence seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened great many indeed said her companion with a sigh have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached house where they were to remain a few days jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further chapter xxxix it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a upstairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise we mean to treat you all added lydia you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out then showing her purchases here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have thought elizabeth would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay lydia laughed and said that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of marrying mary king for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is mary king is safe added elizabeth from a connection imprudent as to is a great fool for going away if she liked i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane am sure there is not on i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of herself the coarseness of the was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of and purchases were seated in it nicely we are crammed in cried lydia am glad i brought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you think she says lizzy had better have taken collins but do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel kitty and me were to spend the day there and forster promised to have a little dance in the evening forster and me are friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you can not imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did forster i thought i should have died and made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of name their reception at home was most kind bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth am glad you are come back their party in the was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her mary said she wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for i should infinitely prefer a but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to of the approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter xl impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between darcy and herself miss astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her refusal must have given him being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his replied elizabeth am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him you oh you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you you know it when i have told you what happened the very next she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other will not do said elizabeth never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all but you shall do as you it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane do not know when i have been more shocked said she so very bad it is almost past belief and poor darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of never thought darcy so deficient in the of it as you used to yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to darcy for now they appear wholly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand miss bennet paused a little and then replied there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion it ought not to be attempted darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to a character we must not make him the tumult of mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery then said she that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity lizzy said bennet one day is your opinion of this sad business of for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i can not find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in housekeeping i dare nothing at great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes will take care not to outrun their income will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that was a subject which they could not mention before it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on chapter xli the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such in any of the family heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion years ago am sure said she cried for two days together when colonel regiment went away i thought i should have broke my am sure i shall break said lydia one could but go to brighton observed bennet yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so little would set me up for my aunt philips is sure it would do a great deal of good added kitty such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their acquaintance they had been intimate the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of forster the delight of bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to her feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish can not see why forster should not ask as well as lydia said she i am her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present you were aware said elizabeth the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the arisen repeated bennet has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she can not grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility in imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her never intending to go there himself but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of leaving home elizabeth was now to see wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel and having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added long did you say that he was at rosings three you saw him frequently almost every manners are very different from his very different but i think darcy improves on cried wickham with a look which did not escape her pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone he is improved in no said elizabeth essentials i believe he is very much what he ever while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents who so well know my feelings towards darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again when the party broke up lydia returned with forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard chapter xlii had opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect it is fortunate thought she i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner surely said she may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and arrival but they did pass away and and gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains gardiner abused her stupidity it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go chapter xliii elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of the valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the it was a large room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings of this place thought she might have been mistress with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while reynolds replied that he was adding we expect him with a large party of how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense is now gone into the army she added i am afraid he has turned out very gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it that said reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years have heard much of your fine person said gardiner looking at the picture is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master that young lady know darcy elizabeth coloured and said do not you think him a very handsome gentleman very am sure know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of this accounted to elizabeth for being among them reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said gardiner yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here with gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister your master much at pemberley in the course of the year so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer thought elizabeth she goes to your master would marry you might see more of sir but i do not know when will be i do not know who is good enough for and gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think say no more than the truth and what everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are when children are when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most boy in the elizabeth almost stared at her this be darcy thought she father was an excellent man said gardiner that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase is the best landlord and the best master said she ever lived not like the wild young men who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor we might be is not very likely our authority was too on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows reynolds anticipated miss delight when she should enter the room this is always the way with him she added can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for the picture gallery and two or three of the principal were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his lifetime there was certainly at this moment in mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw darcy the expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where darcy then was she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words and when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself will be his surprise thought she he knows who they are he takes them now for people of the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating is he so altered from what can it proceed it can not be for it can not be for sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected your housekeeper she added us that you would certainly not be here till and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling will join me early he continued among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you bingley and his elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion mind was not very differently engaged is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage and gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the was over on and coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected is perfectly polite and unassuming said her uncle something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud have seen nothing of was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very be sure lizzy said her aunt is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing what we have seen of him continued gardiner really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and in the eye of a servant comprehends every elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else fatigued as she had been by the walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many discontinuance the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister chapter xliv elizabeth had settled it that darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same ease that he had ever done to and gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were in her favour bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added is above eight months we have not met since the of november when we were all dancing together at elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning it was not often that she could turn her eyes on darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings their visitors stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing and gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear and curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry of darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon chapter xlv convinced as elizabeth now was that miss dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by annesley a genteel woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly than either of the others and between her and gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to in presence she dared not mention name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her recommendation was enough to insure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister very ill eliza bennet looks this morning darcy she cried never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her however little darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer my own part she rejoined must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a without fashion which is persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield a beauty i should as soon call her mother a but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one replied darcy who could contain himself no longer was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what gardiner thought of him and gardiner would have been highly gratified by her beginning the subject chapter xlvi elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one must be first attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i can not be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i can not answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it can not be delayed imprudent as a marriage between wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though short letter to gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel who instantly taking the alarm set off from intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that side london colonel came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i can not think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if could form such a design against a young woman of connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one can not wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again evening in such an exigence my advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by situation hastily exclaimed beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed i have not an instant to god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after and gardiner you are not well enough you can not go elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it can not be concealed from anyone my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of wickham they are gone off together from brighton know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for darcy was fixed in astonishment i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice might have prevented it who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late am grieved indeed cried darcy shocked but is it certain absolutely certain yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to what has been done what has been attempted to recover her father has gone to london and jane has written to beg my immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it can not be he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading second letter had she entertained a hope of meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how acutely did she now feel it she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe and gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them and gardiner could not but be deeply affected not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible what is to be done about pemberley cried gardiner told us darcy was here when you sent for us was it so and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement is all is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn chapter xlvii have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment my word said gardiner begin to be of your opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i can not think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzie so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case the first place replied gardiner is no absolute proof that they are not gone to but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he can not afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes a sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a you see that jane said her aunt not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is do you really know all this cried gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive do indeed replied elizabeth colouring told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives yet replied jane now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be my father in town he went on tuesday as i wrote you have you heard from him often have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to my mother how is she how are you all mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her mary and kitty thank heaven are quite you how are you cried elizabeth look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while and gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and blaming everybody but the person to whose indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing i had been able said she carry my point in going to brighton with all my family would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was as i always am poor dear child and now bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia not give way to useless alarm added he it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be my dear brother replied bennet is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at my heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it but gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself but when questioned by denny denied knowing anything of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many not before they went to brighton i believe did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened it would have been better replied her sister to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed acted with the best colonel forster repeat the particulars of note to his wife brought it with him for us to jane then took it from her and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents nind dear harriet will laugh when you know where i am gone and i can not help laughing myself at your surprise morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you can not guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey affectionate friend thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion jane cried elizabeth there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth she well but under such a misfortune as this one can not see too little of neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter meant i believe replied jane go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as chapter xlviii the whole party were in hopes of a letter from bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of they would have been glad to be certain gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her not being killed in a duel gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows dear sir feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence am dear sir etc gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror gamester she cried is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of which gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon you suppose them to be in london where else can they be so well concealed lydia used to want to go to london added kitty is happy then said her father drily her residence there will probably be of some then after a short silence he continued i bear you no for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her tea is a parade cried he does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully should ever go to brighton i would behave better than go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at least learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry well said he not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of chapter xlix two days after return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to do you mean hill we have heard nothing from madam cried hill in great astonishment you know there is an express come for master from gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said you are looking for my master he is walking towards the little upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle i have had a letter from him by and what news does it bring good or bad is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket perhaps you would like to read elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up it aloud said their father i hardly know myself what it is right street august dear brother last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both it is as i always hoped cried jane are married elizabeth read on have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished it be possible that he will marry her is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister dear father i congratulate have you answered the letter said elizabeth but it must be done most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote my dear father she cried back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a me write for you said jane you dislike the trouble dislike it very much he replied it must be and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house may i ask said elizabeth the terms i suppose must be complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so they marry yet he is a yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay my uncle cried jane do you mean sir mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am is very true said elizabeth it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all said her father a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves strange this is and for we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia comfort myself with thinking replied jane he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i can not believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds we are ever able to learn what debts have been said elizabeth how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence conduct has been such replied elizabeth neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied as you we take my letter to read to her whatever you like and get elizabeth took the letter from his and they went upstairs together mary and kitty were both with bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read hope of being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct dear dear lydia she cried is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which behaviour laid them all under we must attribute this happy conclusion she added a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist wickham with cried her mother is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head will go to meryton said she soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom poor situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained chapter bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and bennet for many years after birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving bennet had no turn for economy and her love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her hands expenses had been very little within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon despatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the wishes for her which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such a husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance park might do said she the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the imprudence of either by receiving them at a long dispute followed this declaration but bennet was firm it soon led to another and bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that wickham had resolved on quitting the militia was greatly my wish that he should do so he added soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my it is intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her yours etc bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of removal from the shire as clearly as gardiner could do but bennet was not so well pleased with it being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites is so fond of forster said she will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general his request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes chapter li their arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the to receive them smiles decked the face of bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness their reception from bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world think of its being three months she cried i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called by each of them and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to hill and the two housemaids mamma said she when they were all returned to the what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i at all like your going such a way off must it be so lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them should like it beyond anything said her mother then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth i do not particularly like your way of getting their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did everything best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than anybody else in the country one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth i never gave an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed really replied elizabeth think there can not be too little said on the you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at because lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for darcy might have done as darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret it was to be a secret said jane not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity will ask you no you said lydia if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be so on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information darcy had been at her wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended may readily comprehend she added my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with that i though she added to herself and she finished the letter my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante chapter lii elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial right street dear niece have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as seems to have been he came to tell gardiner that he had found out where your sister and wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once though bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable everything being settled between next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but gardiner could not be seen and darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no further than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in though i doubt whether reserve or reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for in the affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you everything it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not perceived by letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia imformed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and if he marry his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour very sincerely the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what darcy might have been doing to forward her match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character everything to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between darcy and herself she was roused from her seat and her reflections by approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her certainly do she replied with a smile it does not follow that the interruption must be should be sorry indeed if it were were always good friends and now we are are the others coming out do not know bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen she replied in the affirmative almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to she what did she say you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as you know things are strangely he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth must be something particular to take him there at this time of did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you he introduced us to his do you like her have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out dare say she will she has got over the most trying you go by the village of kympton do not recollect that we mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent it would have suited me in every should you have liked making sermons well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent heard from authority which i thought that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present have yes there was something in i told you so from the first you may hear too that there was a time when was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a smile wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house chapter liii wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and departure soon came and bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth my dear lydia she cried shall we meet again lord i know not these two or three years to me very often my often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to they will have nothing else to adieus were much more affectionate than his he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things is as fine a fellow said bennet as soon as they were out of the house ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable the loss of her daughter made bennet very dull for several days often think said she there is nothing so bad as parting with friends one seems so forlorn without is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth must make you better satisfied that your other four are is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well and so bingley is coming down sister for philips first brought her the news so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so it is quite certain he is coming may depend on it replied the other nichols was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certainly true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said saw you look at me lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of but i dread other elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there his permission or being bold enough to come without it it is hard she sometimes thought this poor man can not come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i leave him to in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again soon as ever bingley comes my dear said bennet will wait on him of no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a errand his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield an i despise said he he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see bingley in consequence of it before did as the day of his arrival drew near begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so bingley arrived bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her window enter the paddock and ride towards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw darcy with him and sat down again by her sister is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty can it be acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not replied kitty looks just like that man that used to be with him before his name that tall proud gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merits she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure me first see how he behaves said she will then be early enough for she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of her how and gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so i expect it to be otherwise said she why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she inquired after his sister but could do no more is a long time bingley since you went away said bennet he readily agreed to it began to be afraid you would never come back again people say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the and the i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said george wickham to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how darcy looked therefore she could not tell is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother at the same time bingley it is very hard to have her taken away from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has friends though perhaps not so many as he elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed you have killed all your own birds bingley said her mother beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the coveys for misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago everything she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion first wish of my heart said she to herself never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentlemen rose to go away bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few time are quite a visit in my debt bingley she added when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year chapter liv as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more behaviour astonished and vexed her if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth said she this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly jane take dear lizzy you can not think me so weak as to be in danger think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the and common politeness of bingley in half an visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards darcy with an expression of alarm his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend he does not come to me said she shall give him up for the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper men come and part us i am determined we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their she was a little revived however by his bringing back his himself and she seized the opportunity of saying your sister at pemberley still she will remain there till quite alone have all her friends left her annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves say you to the day i think everything has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the last week and even darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet elizabeth smiled you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other are very cruel said her sister will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make your chapter lv a few days after this visit bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere time you call said she hope we shall be more he should be particularly happy at any time etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them you come yes he had no engagement at all for and her invitation was accepted with alacrity he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran bennet to her room in her and with her hair half finished crying out dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss will be down as soon as we can said jane i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do child nothing i did not wink at she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that would not give in to it in a few minutes bennet half opened the door and called out my dear i want to speak with elizabeth was forced to go may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall and i are going upstairs to sit in my elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her schemes but on her returning to the when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all situation was awkward enough but she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world too much she added far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not everybody as happy congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present must go instantly to my mother she cried would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the and was sitting upstairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation this said she the end of all his anxious circumspection of all his falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door my mother upstairs she will be down in a moment i dare he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said i congratulate you you will be a very happy jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness are a good girl he replied i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in their income my dear bennet cried his wife are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely then addressing her daughter my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief has made me so happy said she one evening telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it suspected as much replied elizabeth how did he account for it must have been his doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i can not wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss pretended you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another collins in the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret bennet was privileged to whisper it to philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune chapter lvi one morning about a week after engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her entrance though no request of introduction had been made bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother elizabeth replied very concisely that she was i suppose is one of your sisters madam said bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the ground walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william must be a most inconvenient for the evening in summer the windows are full bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left and collins well very well i saw them the night before elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your my dear cried her mother show her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the and and pronouncing them after a short survey to be rooms walked on her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere may choose to be you shall not find so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew darcy though i it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it once to insist upon having such a report universally coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad never heard that it can you likewise declare that there is no for it do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship may ask questions which shall not choose to is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage ladyship has declared it to be ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him i have i shall be the last person to confess bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest you are not entitled to know nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never darcy is engaged to now what have you to say this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth the wife of darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any whims i have not been in the habit of brooking will make your situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a daughter so far we are you a daughter but what was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their my connections may be said elizabeth your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a deliberation am lady catherine seemed pleased will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement will make no promise of the bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i i certainly shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the promise make marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in affairs i can not tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no further on the so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest infamous elopement i know it all that the young marrying her was a business at the expense of your father and uncle and is a girl to be my sister is husband who is the son of his late steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted can have nothing further to say she resentfully answered have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody catherine i have nothing further to say you know my are then resolved to have him have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to or to any person so wholly unconnected with is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former excited by his marrying me it would not give me one concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of her to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself did not choose it said her daughter would is a very woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible chapter lvii the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that being the intimate friend of bingley and being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set down as almost certain and immediate which had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand said he was going to look for you come into my she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fireplace and they both sat down he then said have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important the colour now rushed into cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from collins and what can have to say very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows thus offered you the sincere congratulations of collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her eldest sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with everything the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly you see is the man now lizzy i think i surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her you not diverted yes pray read mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly collins moreover adds am truly rejoiced that my cousin sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear situation and his expectation of a young but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn cried elizabeth am exceedingly diverted but it is so strange is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but perfect indifference and pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i can not help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too she might have fancied too chapter lviii instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady visit the gentlemen arrived early and before bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards the because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think gardiner was so little to be must not blame my aunt thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering you thank me he replied it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise taught me to hope said he i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied you know enough of my to believe me capable of after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i can not think of it without will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in can not be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget you behaved in a more gentlemanlike those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of darcy mentioned his letter it said he it make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effects on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed knew said he what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that i wrote that letter replied darcy believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with it is not so painful recollections will intrude which can not which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being you then persuaded yourself that i should i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after evening you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming indeed i felt nothing but surprise could not be greater than in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive than my object replied darcy to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen he then told her of delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home could have become of bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth at all when i went away i felt that it would soon is to say you had given your permission i guessed as and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case the evening before my going to london said he made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend you speak from your own observation said she you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made everything easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sentiments he has heartily forgiven me elizabeth longed to observe that bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted chapter lix dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather that she was happy than herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far from miss general habits she was absolutely incredulous here are joking lizzy this can not be engaged to darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are jane looked at her doubtingly lizzy it can not be i know how much you dislike know nothing of the matter is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do yes you will only think i feel than i ought to do when i tell you do you mean i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be dearest sister now be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know everything that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish i am quite happy said she you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation gracious cried bennet as she stood at a window the next morning that disagreeable darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again advise darcy and lizzy and kitty said bennet walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and darcy has never seen the may do very well for the others replied bingley i am sure it will be too much for kitty it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went upstairs to get ready bennet followed her saying am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to during their walk it was resolved that consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation in the evening soon after bennet withdrew to the library she saw darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper to your father he wants you in the she was gone directly her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious said he are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to darcy in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy you any other objection said elizabeth your belief of my indifference at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such said her father have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her incredulity and reconcile him to the match my dear said he when she ceased speaking have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less to complete the favourable impression she then told him what darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did everything made up the match gave the money paid the debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your doing i must and have paid him but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way i shall offer to pay him he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself gracious lord bless me only think dear me darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what what jewels what carriages you will have is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town everything that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her dearest child she cried can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it this was a sad omen of what her behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem admire all my three highly said he perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like husband quite as well as chapter lx spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her could you begin said she can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place can not fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence the liveliness of your mind i may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you know no actual good of me but nobody thinks of when they fall in there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me you were grave and silent and gave me no i was so was might have talked to me more when you came to man who had felt less unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours my intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequences real purpose was to see and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered long letter but now having to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but suppose as much as you choose give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you can not greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but no one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what bennet sent to collins in return for his last sir must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give sincerely etc miss congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which encouraged yet whenever she speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley chapter lxi happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited bingley and talked of darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to easy temper or affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of society she was of course carefully kept and though wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of everything was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect dear lizzy wish you joy if you love darcy half so well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to darcy about it if you had rather not etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive at pemberley yet for sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long that even was overcome and he proceeded so far as to of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropped all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them chiswick press charles whittingham and tooks court chancery lane
