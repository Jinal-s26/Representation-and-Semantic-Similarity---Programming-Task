# Text Representation and Semantic Similarity

This repository contains code and documentation for a programming task focused on text representation and semantic similarity tasks. The task covers various aspects, including word similarity scores, phrase and sentence similarity, and bonus tasks involving transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs).

## Task Overview

The programming task consists of the following components:

1. **Word Similarity Scores:**
   - Implementing unsupervised/semi-supervised methods to predict similarity scores between pairs of words using different approaches such as transition matrix methods and neural network models with word embeddings.

2. **Phrase and Sentence Similarity:**
   - Developing mechanisms to obtain representations for phrases and sentences using static word embeddings like GloVe and contextual embeddings like DistilBERT. Solutions are provided for both phrase and sentence similarity tasks, along with comparative analysis.

3. **Bonus Task:**
   - Fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer-based model (DistilBERT) to solve phrase and sentence similarity tasks.
   - Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Bard, and all-mpnet-base-v2 to solve phrase and sentence similarity scores in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Comparative analysis is conducted across different LLMs and fine-tuned models.

4. **Paper Reading Task:**
   - Analysis of the paper "BERTScore: Evaluating Text Generation with BERT" as part of the task requirements. https://www.canva.com/design/DAGHYWAD92I/_bg4KElaVJhkE5lUkuI16w/edit?utm_content=DAGHYWAD92I&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
